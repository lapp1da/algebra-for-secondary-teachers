  "title": "A Brief History of Standards for Mathematics Education: Algebraic Perspectives",
  "body": " A Brief History of Standards for Mathematics Education: Algebraic Perspectives   Although the Principle and Standards for School Mathematics (PSSM) (NCTM, 2000) and the Common Core State Standards (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010) treat algebra as a standard for PreK-12, society tends to view algebra as a part of mathematics relegated to the secondary curriculum. In fact, even mathematicians often fail to understand how algebra could be taught to a first grader. Why is there such a misunderstanding between organizations such as NCTM and society? Why is there such a misunderstanding between NCTM and the mathematics community? Perhaps in order to understand why these differences in the perception of algebra exist, we must first look at the historical and traditional teaching of algebra in the United States.  Much of why we see slow advancement of educational practice is that humans are often change-averse. For example, consider the \"traditional\" secondary curriculum consisting of the sequence of courses: Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, and PreCalculus. Why are these courses in the sequence that they are? Doesn't it seem odd that Geometry is sandwiched between Algebra 1 and 2? Why are the subareas of mathematics separate at all? As it turns out, tradition is the real reason we see approaches like integrated curricula (which have much support from research) mounting so much resistance. The current sequence of Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, and PreCalculus actually dates back to 1894. Let me say that again, 1894 ! In 1894, the National Education Association (NEA) was dealing with the fact that very few students completed high school. There was a desire to make sure as many students as possible had some exposure to both algebra and geometry before leaving school. The solution — teach Algebra 1 followed immediately by Geometry. This means that the typical student would see both by the end of the sophomore year when they might leave formal education (Reys and Reys, 2009; NEA, 1894). So to sum things up, the current system typically used for secondary mathematics curricula dates back to a time over 125 years ago where the motivation was the fact that very few students finished high school. For this reason, as educators, we should always be asking ourselves why we do what we do? We need to look at the research and ask if the assumptions we make are still valid assumptions. The reasons, \"Because that's the way we've always done it\" or \"Because that's the way I learned it\" are not sufficient for rational decision making.  Given that our current curricular structure exists for reasons that are no longer relevant, we are faced with the reality that old choices also shape current perception of the mathematics we teach. For algebra, we need to ask the questions of what is algebra and why do we view it as we do, before we can address how best to teach it. Suppose you were to ask the person on the street to describe algebra. What sort of response would you get? What about mathematics in general? This question was asked of a student from a Minnesota high school during ABC's Primetime Live following the release of the results from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (ABC News, 1998). In response to this question she replied, “It's kind of a set in stone. It's procedure. It's a formula. You learn the formula and you know how to do math.”  Her perceptions of mathematics and, in particular, algebra, are not unique. In fact, the argument could be made that this is the perception of the majority of people — even those who are well educated. So, we must ask the question of why do so many people view mathematics as a set of procedures to be memorized? This question is of particular interest as we explore the teaching and learning of algebra since so many algebra texts are structured in such a way as to perpetuate this view.  Think back to your own algebra courses. What were the items you remember most from your textbooks? Can you recall shaded boxes housing formulae and “rules”? Do you recall the “Laws of Exponents” prominently displayed on the page? Did you ever think to question them? Or did you ever wonder why they were presented in the text before any examples like were even discussed? Maybe this is the reason society holds a very procedural and limited view of algebra.  In this text, we will explore not only the teaching and learning of algebra, but also the very nature of this branch of mathematics. If we wish to understand how students learn mathematics, we must first ask questions about the nature of the mathematics to be learned. If mathematics indeed is a set of procedures to be memorized as suggested in the quote given above, then there are certain strategies that can be employed to facilitate the memorization. This would then be an appropriate method of teaching. However, if the nature of mathematics is far more than the memorization of a set of rules, the strategies employed for learning mathematics will be completely different from those employed for memorization.    A Brief History of Mathematics Standards  Believe it or not, the first attempt at developing some comprehensive standards for what mathematics should be taught did not occur until 1989. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) put forth the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics in 1989. Since each state had control over what was taught in its schools, there was quite a variation of content covered from grade-to-grade depending on the state. The attempt by NCTM to put in writing some basic expectations was a move forward in articulating what it means to do mathematics. The Standards , as they were called, were followed by a series of Addenda that spelled out in greater detail what it meant to teach the Standards by providing examples in various subareas of mathematics.  Following the release of The Standards , NCTM developed the Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics in 1991. The Professional Standards , as they were referred to, focused on how a teacher should teach the Standards. The Professional Standards were broken up into three key components: Process Standards, Teaching Standards, and Professional Development Standards. The Process Standards dealt with essential processes of mathematical thinking including problem solving, reasoning and proof, communication, representation, and connections. The Teaching Standards included discussion of what is a worthwhile mathematical task, the teacher's role in promoting discourse, what is the student's role in discourse, tools that enhance mathematical discourse, how to create an effective learning environment, and how to analyze teaching and learning. The Professional Development Standards dealt with a teacher's knowledge of mathematics, pedagogical knowledge, knowledge of students as learners, and their own reflective practices as teachers.  Now it should be noted that both The Standards and the Professional Standards were based on decades of research on teaching and learning, but were written in a concise way without much attention to citation of the research in the text itself. One of the criticisms of these standards was that they lacked support by research. For this reason, in 2000, NCTM release an updated version of the earlier standards, called the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (PSSM). In the revised version, greater detail was provided for the research support of the PSSM.  While the PSSM provided research-based guidance for what and how to teach mathematics, it still lacked one thing...teeth. Since NCTM is a professional organization without authority to require schools or states to implement these standards, movement to adopt them was slow. Recall that one of the motivations for standards in the first place was the need to have a cohesive curriculum that would allow for people to move from state to state without having their children subjected to gaps in learning. Suppose a child in a state would normally be taught how to work with fractions in grade 5, but moved to another state after finishing grade 4 where working with fractions was taught in grade 4. The student would miss this content and be behind as they began grade 5. The only way to avoid this problem would be for the states to agree on both the mathematical content to be taught at the various grade levels and the way in which the mathematics should be taught.  Enter The National Governors Association Center for Best Practices (NGACBP) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO). These governmental groups decided to take what NCTM had developed and codify it into commonly agreed upon standards that all states would adpot as their state's curriculum. As stated in the introduction to this chapter, there we called the Common Core State Standards and adopted by the vast majority of the states (41 at the time of this writing).  The path to the Common Core State Standards was not a top-down approach. It involved a great number of stake-holders. The process began in 2007 when the State Chiefs met in Columbus, OH, at the CCSSO Annual Policy Forum. There they discussed the creation of such common standards. In December 2008, the NGA and CCSSO released the report, Benchmarking for Success: Ensuring U.S. Students Receive a World-Class Education , lead by an advisory team consisting of state governors, state education leaderships, and leading educational researchers. This advisory group suggested that the states, “upgrade state standards by adopting a common core of internationally benchmarked standards in math and language arts for grades K-12 to ensure that students are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to be globally competitive.”  In April 2009, the NGA and CCSSO organized a meeting of governors' education policy advisors and chief state school officers in Chicago to explore the creation of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. After the meeting, NGA and CCSSO asked states to commit to a process to develop these common standards in both English language arts\/literacy and mathematics as these are the foundational subject areas students need for learning in other areas. As States showed interest, the work to develop the CCSS began.  In June of 2009, CCSSO and NGA reported commitment from governors and chief state school officers from 49 states and territories to be involved in the state-led process to develop CCSS in for English language arts\/literacy and mathematics. By September of 2009, the finally tally included 51 states and territories.  In Summer 2009, working groups and feedback groups are created to develop and review the K-12 standards. As this was not just a top-down process, it is important that K-12 teachers were involved in these working groups at all stages of the review process. The in September of 2009, a draft version of the college and career readiness standards (composed of input from the standards' writing team, state education agency leaders, and a panel of outside educational experts and practitioners) was released. These standards consisted of a summary of close to 1,000 responses, received from educators and the public.  In October 2009, feedback was given from a validation committee composed of experts on college and career readiness needs. The in November 2009, the first draft of the K-12 grade by grade college and career readiness standards was released for comment by the educational leaderships of the states. The draft of the college and career readiness standards was integrated into the grade by grade standards.  In December 2009, the validation committee provided edits on the K-12 grade by grade college and career readiness standards. Early 2010 consisted of back-and-forth release of drafts and revisions to both independent reviewers and the states. The comments given by these stake-holders were then incorporated into the document and in March 2010, a final draft of the Common Core State Standards was released to the public via the CCSS website. Both the general public and educators then provided additional feedback and the final version of the Commonn Core State Standards (for both Mathematics and English) was released in June 2010.  After the release of the CCSS, the states began a process in 2011 of reviewing the document and adopting it. In some cases this involved a state legislature ratifying the new set of standards. After adoption, the states then began a process of replacing the existing set of standards in their states and transitioning to the newly adpoted CCSS. This continued into 2012 and in 2013, 45 states, the Department of Defense Education Activity, Washington D.C., Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands had adopted the CCSS in ELA\/literacy and mathematics. You will notice that the current number of states\/territories that have adopted the CCSS are slightly less. This is due to the fact that some states decided to withdraw from the standards after reviewing the final version. This is where we stand today with respect to the current state of standards for school mathematics.    Pirie and Kieren Model for Mathematical Understanding   Traditionally, mathematical content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge have been the main parts of a dichotomous preparation program for teachers. Research suggests that this approach to the preparation of teachers is inadequate. How can we separate mathematics and the teaching and learning of mathematics? Is it possible to learn how to teach devoid of specific content knowledge? If so, then this would suggest that students learn language, social studies, art, science, and mathematics all the same way. While there are many common aspects of teaching and learning that resonate across many subject disciplines, the literature suggests that some disciplines have nuanced processes for learning that differ from other disciplines. So, if students learn different subjects differently, why do we tend to separate the mathematical content for preservice teachers from the pedagogical content? It is our opinion that both mathematical content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge need to develop simultaneously. For this reason, we will take a unified approach to integrate mathematical learning with the theories and practice for teaching.  We have now stated our position as it relates to the integration of mathematical and pedagogical content knowledge, but how should this integration be accomplished? In order to develop both mathematical and pedagogical content knowledge simultaneously, we first must ask ourselves how we come to know either of these. To this end, we now discuss the theoretical model that guides our approach and this text.  In order to understand the significance of both the explorations and the reflective practice combined in this text, we first will give an overview of the theoretical framework guiding our approach to the integration of mathematical and pedagogical content knowledge. We have adopted the theory of growth of mathematical understanding put forth by Pirie and Kieren (1994) as our model for these materials and this will guide both the mathematical learning experiences and the pedagogical reflection in which the reader will engage throughout this course. In addition, we will later utilize Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno's (2008) model that elaborates on the mechanisms at play as a learner moves through the levels found in the Pirie and Kieren model from a symbolic (or semiotic) point of view.   In order to understand the significance of both the explorations and the reflective practice combined in this text, we first will give an overview of the theoretical framework guiding our approach to the integration of mathematical and pedagogical content knowledge. We have adopted the theory of growth of mathematical understanding put forth by Pirie and Kieren (1994) as our model for these materials and this will guide both the mathematical learning experiences and the pedagogical reflection in which the reader will engage throughout this course. In addition, we will later utilize Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno's (2008) model that elaborates on the mechanisms at play as a learner moves through the levels found in the Pirie and Kieren model from a symbolic (or semiotic) point of view.  In the Pirie and Kieren model, the growth of mathematical understanding occurs throughout eight levels. We are careful here to use the word “throughout” since we do not want to give the impression that these levels are linear. In fact, their theory characterizes mathematical growth as a whole, dynamic, leveled but nonlinear, transcendently recursive process (Kieren and Pirie, 1991). The Pirie and Kieren model is an elaboration of the constructivist view of understanding as a continuing organization of knowledge structures as described by von Glasersfeld (1987), but we must also consider that we have the ability to influence and shape each others understanding because learning is a social process (Vygotsky, 1978). Freeman et al. (2014) suggest that active learning where students are engaged in experiences rather than passively listening to an instructor promotes greater depth of understanding and so we will take this approach in this text. In addition, communication also plays a role in our thinking as Sfard (2008) suggests and so we need to be mindful of these dynamically linked components of learning if we are to create an environment where exploration and student autonomy are key parts of concept development.  In order to visualize this model for growth of mathematical understanding consider the diagram below.    Pirie and Kieren's Model (1994, p. 167)     Here the model is viewed as concentric circles or layers with each new layer containing the previous layers much like peeling an onion. It is also important to note that there is not a single directional movement from inner to outer layers, but rather a student may move back and forth between layers as they work on organizing knowledge in a dynamic process of creating understanding.  It is also important to state that although this model does have an underlying hierarchy to its levels or layers, there is no intentional judgment of the outer layers being better or more advanced mathematically. In fact, as new mathematics is developed we often see experienced mathematicians moving through various levels of this model. The innermost layer called, Primitive Knowing, does not imply a low-level understanding of concepts, but rather a basic series of knowledge and skills needed to pursue a new concept that is under development. For example, the Primitive Knowing layer for a new concept being developed by the learner may actually represent an outermost layer of understanding for a previously developed concept that is utilized in the development of the new concept. Pirie and Kieren use the example of fractions and decimals where a fairly sophisticated understanding of fractions is used as a starting point for the development of decimal concepts. In a sense, this could be thought of as an onion within an onion (see ) to use our “garden” variety analogy.    Nested Layers of Understanding (Pirie and Kieren, 1994, p. 172)     Now that we have an overview of how the levels of Pirie and Kieren's model fit together, let us discuss each level in more detail. The eight levels beginning with Primitive Knowing and ending with Inventizing can be characterized in the following way.     Primitive Knowing : The basic knowledge, skills, and understanding the learner has relative to the development of new understanding.    Image Making : The learner uses previous understanding in a new way to make distinctions and advance understanding through a process of concept development.     Image Having : The learner no longer must do the specific activities that brought about a mental construct, but can now use that construct directly.     Property Noticing : The learner can manipulate and use combinations of various parts of the newly developed mental images to construct pertinent features or properties within a specific context.     Formalizing : The learner can abstract characteristics from the prior image-dependent knowledge that exemplified the properties noticed in the earlier level.     Observing : The learner has the ability to reflect on formalizations and express these reflections as theorems.     Structuring : The learner begins to think about formal observations as an interconnected and interrelated set of theorems coming together to form a theory. The learner also now sees the need for verification and justification of mathematical propositions through proof or arguments.     Inventizing : The learner has a deeply developed and structured understanding of the topic and can move away from the basic concepts that gave rise to the understanding and ask new questions that might lead to the development of new concepts.      One feature of the Pirie and Kieren theory that relates to the teaching and learning of algebra specifically is the description of progression of abstraction from a symbolic sense. You may have noticed some bold rings in the diagram above ( ) describing the layers involved in this model. These bold rings are referred to as the “don't need” boundaries. The bold rings are used to convey the idea that once students get past a “don't need” boundary, they can now work in a more abstract sense without accessing specific inner understanding or images that were found within the bold boundary that gave rise to the understanding that is found in the outer region. This is a significant part of the theory as it relates to algebra since one of the most important goals of the teaching and learning of algebra is bringing the student to higher and higher levels of abstraction. We will address the role of abstraction in greater detail later, but here it is important to point out this aspect of the general theory guiding the text.  To this point we have simply described the nature of each level of the Pirie and Kieren model and how they fit together, but there is a more powerful aspect of the theory that makes it particularly useful in grappling with how mathematical understanding comes to be. In order to explain mathematical understanding, we need to include a mechanism for explaining the growth. In the Pirie and Kieren model, this mechanism is called folding back .  It is important to acknowledge that as we learn, there are varying depths of our understanding as related to any particular topic or concept. We have all experienced this when we first learn about a new idea and can even use that mathematical idea to solve problems only to later encounter the same idea within a different context and be surprised by the new application of such an old idea. This element of surprise is the evidence that our understanding of that idea has just deepened. Pirie and Kieren account for this growth in the depth of understanding through the construct of folding back . Basically, folding back is the learner's ability to revert back to an inner layer of the understanding process in order to make sense of a situation or problem that is not readily solvable or understandable at the learner’s current level. It is important to note that this return to prior levels is not similar to the experience the learner had previously in that earlier level, but rather is also influenced by the deeper understanding that has been obtained in the outer level as well. The re-visitation to the inner level results in what Pirie and Kieren refer to as a thickening of the inner layer. There is no unique pathway in which this thickening occurs since the number and manner of the folds backward are unique to the individual learner. This process emphasizes that the levels or layers of this model of mathematical understanding do not occur in a single direction, but occur in a series of steps that involve the interactions of both older and newer levels of understanding.  The third and final feature of Pirie and Kieren's model we wish to highlight is the structure that takes place within each layer or level. Here, for each level beyond Primitive Knowing the levels are partitioned into two complementary modes: acting and expressing. Both of these components of understanding are essential before moving on from the inner to the outer levels. This elaboration of the model is given a graphic interpretation below with dotted lines representing the boundaries between modes.    Pirie and Kieren's Extended Model (1994, p. 176)     To illustrate the difference between these components of each level, let us consider the example given by Pirie and Kieren (1994, pp. 176-178). Students were given the following tasks.  Consider the function . Make a table of values for and , taking values from -3 to +3. Now draw the graph of the function. Repeat this for the following functions: , , , . (Pirie and Kieren, 1994, p. 176)  If we examine the first function, we can see how the students' responses are related to their location within the model. After the students had been given the opportunity to sketch several of the graphs, the teacher then gave a new point, to include in the graph of the first function, . The students' responses help illustrate the components of the various levels. For example, if a student simply connects the new point to the end of the existing graph as in graph (b) in , this student is still image doing. Here the student is still simply following directions and not reflecting on the different graphs. Now suppose the student eliminates the segment between and and then proceeds to connect the new point into the graph as shown in (c). This student is image reviewing since they have reviewed their previous graphs and inserted the new point into a pattern that they think the graph should follow. These two examples describe students who are in the Image Making level of the Pirie and Kieren model.    Image Making Examples (Pirie and Kieren, 1994, p. 178)     The Image Having level of the model consists of the two complementary components titled Image Saying and Image Seeing . In relation to the previous example, a student in the image seeing part of the level might make statements such as, “ 'that can't be right', 'it can't go there', or who, when having joined up the new point, [say] 'that doesn't look right' ” (Pirie and Kieren, 1994, p.178). In contrast, a student in the image saying level might make statements like, “ 'I thought they should all be U-shaped' or 'we've already got a point for ' ” (Pirie and Kieren, 1994, p.178). These comments help illustrate the “acting” and “expressing” components of each level. In the image seeing part, the student has begun to advance their understanding through the review of the previously sketched graphs and subsequent construction of mental images for the graphs of a specific family of functions. In the image saying part, the student can go beyond simply acknowledging a pattern and can also articulate why the point does not fit the image.  We have discussed the differences of the components within each of these two levels of understanding, but how are the levels themselves different? Using the same example, consider what the learner engaged in the Image Making level is capable of accomplishing. Here the student is primarily involved in activities that result in observable consequences that they must then make sense of in order to fit the observations into an existing schema. In contrast, in the Image Having level, the learner can now work with the images (in this case, noting that quadratics have certain features or characteristics) without the need to conduct the same types of activities that were required in the Image Making level.  While Pirie and Kieren use the construct of folding back to explain how a student progresses through the deepening levels of understanding, this model still fails to explain the details of how the student connects concepts within this process so that folding back can occur. Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno (2008) provide a model that fills this gap. Next, we will explore how the interaction between symbol systems and the ideas they represent fuel the development of understanding and allow the folding back process to take place.    Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno Model for Symbolic Meaning   One of the powerful aspects of mathematics is its use of symbolization. On the other hand, from the aspect of the learner, one of its worst obstacles is its symbolization. Since the early development of mathematics, power has come from the development of symbol systems used to describe the concepts that are fundamental to furthering mathematical knowledge. The encapsulation of big ideas, that before took pages and pages to communicate, into smaller collections of symbols allows the reader to see various stages of arguments within one field of view. However, from a learner's perspective, it is the unpacking of the symbolization that poses a significant hurdle in the development of conceptual understanding.   If we think of this in terms of concept image and concept definition (Tall and Vinner, 1981), a small collection of symbols typically elicits much more information than could be contained in paragraphs of written prose. Tall and Vinner describe concept image as “the total cognitive structure that is associated with the concept, which includes all the mental pictures and associated properties and processes.” (p. 152). In contrast, the concept definition can be described as “a form of words used to specify that concept” (p. 152).  For example, suppose we say the word “dog”. What comes to mind? It might likely be a mental image of a beloved pet from your childhood or an image of a traumatic event you had with a strange animal while walking last week. These images are far more complex than the simple three letters “dog” or a formal definition from Webster's dictionary. It is our experiences that are connected to the compact system of symbols “dog” that form our concept image of a dog. Similarly, it is the experiences that a student has between mathematical ideas and the symbols that represent them that determine her\/his concept image for a given concept definition.  So how does the use of symbol systems influence our learning, and even more, our development of new ideas? Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno (2008) propose a model that describes how we develop both our understanding of existing ideas as well as the creation new concepts. The key to this model is the communication and analysis between two worlds. One is the \"real world\" (i.e. the world of either broader mathematical or physical experiences) and the other is the world of the symbols that we use to represent these \"real world\" experiences. In this model, the learner creates raw representations of ideas and in turn these representations provide the learner with a tool to reason about these ideas. As the learner uses these raw representations for reasoning, they begin to view the \"real world\" experiences differently as the representations serve as a lens through which reality is filtered. As this process progresses, new, more refined representations and symbols are created influencing both the tools used for reasoning as well as the learner's view of the real world itself ( ). You will note that the diagram contains various incarnations of reality as influenced by different symbol systems. Reality is a social construct (although there are certain facts about the world around us) in that we interpret information collected by our senses through the lenses of our experience. Here represents reality ( ) as viewed through the representation system, . Similarly, represents reality ( ) as viewed through the representation system, , and so on. Our view of reality is constantly evolving, influenced by our experiences.    Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno Model (2008, p. 30)     It is important to note that this process, while focusing on representations, is consistent with Sfard's (1991) process of interiorization , condensation , and reification where concepts become internalized through interaction with the various natures of the mathematical ideas. In some ways, the use of technology here reduces the length of time for Sfard's interiorization and facilitates the condensation process. Alleviating the computational load can also keep the lack of procedural fluency from becoming a cognitive obstacle to reaching condensation or reification as observed by Lapp, Nyman, and Berry (2010).  Expanding on our earlier discussion of perception of reality, in , we begin with experiences in the world ( ) and then create a set of raw representations ( ) to describe these experiences. These raw representations can take forms such as rough diagrams, written prose, or pictures. In turn, the representations we create give us a means to reason about the mathematical ideas, influencing how we view reality ( ) based on the representations we previously created. Now in light of our new perspective of the world, our representations eventually prove inadequate for dealing with new information. Thus, we create more refined sets of representations ( ) such as graphs, more refined algebraic expressions, or tables to deal with our new view of reality. As a result, our view of reality ( ) is influenced relative to our new symbol system and this process continues as our symbolization evolves.  The diagram given in only tells part of the story when it comes to the development of symbolization. Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno (2008) also point out that each more refined symbol system does not necessarily supplant the previous system, but rather adds to the existing system and the way the learner views reality. Therefore, both the symbol system and the perception of reality from previous iterations of this process become subsets of systems that are found within new and more extensive views of mathematics ( ). In a way, it is the retention of the old symbol systems that aid in the folding back process described by Pirie and Kieren (1994). The interplay between the old and new symbol systems provides a vehicle for the student to begin to see an old and less sophisticated understanding of a concept through a new lens with respect to the new symbols. In turn, the new symbols provide a way to reason about an old idea in a more advanced way paving the path to a deeper understanding.    Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno Nested Model (2008, p. 31)     The goal of this section was to give an overview of the theoretical model used to guide our perspective on how mathematical understanding comes to be—in particular, how this model is helpful in understanding the teaching and learning of algebraic ideas. We will not elaborate on each level of the Pirie and Kieren model, but if the reader wishes a more in-depth description of the levels and components of the model, you should read the article by Pirie and Kieren (1994). Throughout this course, you will be expected to apply this model along with that of Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno (2008) to various vignettes and cases as a mechanism for analyzing student work and making decisions related to teaching in the secondary classroom.

  "title": "Common Core State Standards for Mathematics",
  "body": " Common Core State Standards for Mathematics   The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010) are broken into two areas. When most people think of mathematics standards, the first things that come to mind are usually standards related to what mathematics will be taught. We refer to these as the Standards for Mathematical Content or more simply, the Content Standards . Since this is the most common expectation, in this section, we will discuss it first. However, the other equally-important part of the CCSS are the Standards for Mathematical Practice that lay out the expectations for \"habits of mind\" that we need students to have in order to do mathematics. We will adress these Math Practices in the next section.    CCSS: Content Standards  The Content Standards are broken down by grade level for the K-8 grades, but then are arranged by content areas once we get to high school. The standards are organized into domains that progress over several grades so that it is easier to see learning trajectories and expectations as students move through the curriculum. For each grade in the K-8 band, the grade begins with generally 2 to 4 focal points to show the broader goals for that particular grade. Since at the high school level, students in various grades may be taking different mathematics classes than their counterparts, standards are presented by conceptual theme ( Number and Quantity , Algebra , Functions , Modeling , Geometry , Statistics and Probability ).  The Content Standards are more specific and define what students should understand and be able to do and thus are the most refined categorization. Since many of these standards are linked, the standards are then organized into Clusters which are groups of related standards. Domains are then larger groups that progress across grades (see ).    Organization of CCSS   CCSS Organization     Within the K-8 band, the standards for that grade begin with an overview of what is expected. This gives the teacher a broad view of the goals for that grade level (see ).    Grade Level Overview   Grade Level Overview     You will notice in the Grade 5 Overview, Operations and Algebraic Thinking appear first. For many people, \"algebra\" means manipulating letters and symbols, but the CCSS have algebraic thinking as a goal beginning in kindergarten. Algebra is far more than the maipulating of symbols and the movement toward abstraction begins early. Algebraic thinking involves noticing, expressing, and analyzing patterns and these are activities where young learners excel until our curriculum often suppresses it by focusing on memorization and procedural fluency. We will discuss the nature of algebra in greater detail later in the text, but for now, it is important to realize that the foundation for what we want students to be able to understand later in formal algebra courses begins with patterning. For an interesting read on how algebra develops in young learners, consider, Algebra in the Early Grades by Kaput, Carraher, and Blanton (2008).  As the CCSS get to Grade 8, there is a more deliberate move toward symbolization. Here the expectations include things like \"Analyze and solve linear equations and pairs of simultaneous linear equations\", \"Define, evaluate, and compare functions\", and \"Use functions to model relationships between quantities\". This does not mean that symbolic forms are not expected in the earlier grades, but rather that in Grade 8, formalization of these concepts should be a focus of the curriculum. For this reason, the CCSS also provides a summary of focal points at the beginning of each grade level (K-8). An example of this can be seen in .    Grade Level Overview   Grade Level Focal Points     The high school standards, as stated earlier, are organized into the conceptual themes of Number and Quantity , Algebra , Functions , Modeling , Geometry , Statistics and Probability . For the purpose of this text, we will focus mainly on Algebra , but keep in mind that it is difficult to discuss algebraic ideas without the use of Functions and Modeling as these applications drive much of our need for algebraic structure. Like the K-8 grade-level standards, the high school standards also give a summary of focal points for each theme so that the teacher has an idea of how the content should be approached when teaching it.    CCSS: Standards for Mathematical Practice  While the mathematical content of what should be taught at various grade levels is often the major focus of the curriculum or standards, there is a much broader view that is equally important when it comes to developing mathematical thinking. It is not enough to \"know\" content. If we realize that mathematics is a creative endeavor, we must also address the habits of mind that need to be developed for mathematical thinking. For this reason, the Common Core State Standards was intentionally partitioned into two parts in order to make this point clear. In fact, when you read through the CCSS, you will notice that these habits or mind are actually listed first before the Content Standards are addressed. This drives home the importance of these mental processes that are so essential for preparing students to be good mathematical thinkers (or overall critical thinkers for that matter). We have described the Content Standards, but now we need to address the Standards for Mathematical Practice (see ). These standards describe the 8 basic habits of mind that we need students to possess in order to use the mathematics content knowledge effectively and creatively. In the list below, you can see greater detail for what is intended by each practice by clicking on the \"hint\" link below the listed practice.          Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.  \"Mathematically proficient students start by explaining to themselves the meaning of a problem and looking for entry points to its solution. They analyze givens, constraints, relationships, and goals. They make conjectures about the form and meaning of the solution and plan a solution pathway rather than simply jumping into a solution attempt. They consider analogous problems, and try special cases and simpler forms of the original problem in order to gain insight into its solution. They monitor and evaluate their progress and change course if necessary. Older students might, depending on the context of the problem, transform algebraic expressions or change the viewing window on their graphing calculator to get the information they need. Mathematically proficient students can explain correspondences between equations, verbal descriptions, tables, and graphs or draw diagrams of important features and relationships, graph data, and search for regularity or trends. Younger students might rely on using concrete objects or pictures to help conceptualize and solve a problem. Mathematically proficient students check their answers to problems using a different method, and they continually ask themselves, “Does this make sense?” They can understand the approaches of others to solving complex problems and identify correspondences between different approaches.\" (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010, p. 6)      Reason abstractly and quantitatively.  \"Mathematically proficient students make sense of quantities and their relationships in problem situations. They bring two complementary abilities to bear on problems involving quantitative relationships: the ability to decontextualize—to abstract a given situation and represent it symbolically and manipulate the representing symbols as if they have a life of their own, without necessarily attending to their referents—and the ability to contextualize, to pause as needed during the manipulation process in order to probe into the referents for the symbols involved. Quantitative reasoning entails habits of creating a coherent representation of the problem at hand; considering the units involved; attending to the meaning of quantities, not just how to compute them; and knowing and flexibly using different properties of operations and objects.\" (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010, p. 6)      Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.  \"Mathematically proficient students understand and use stated assumptions, definitions, and previously established results in constructing arguments. They make conjectures and build a logical progression of statements to explore the truth of their conjectures. They are able to analyze situations by breaking them into cases, and can recognize and use counterexamples. They justify their conclusions, communicate them to others, and respond to the arguments of others. They reason inductively about data, making plausible arguments that take into account the context from which the data arose. Mathematically proficient students are also able to compare the effectiveness of two plausible arguments, distinguish correct logic or reasoning from that which is flawed, and—if there is a flaw in an argument—explain what it is. Elementary students can construct arguments using concrete referents such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and actions. Such arguments can make sense and be correct, even though they are not generalized or made formal until later grades. Later, students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies. Students at all grades can listen or read the arguments of others, decide whether they make sense, and ask useful questions to clarify or improve the arguments.\" (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010, p. 6-7)      Model with mathematics.  \"Mathematically proficient students can apply the mathematics they know to solve problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace. In early grades, this might be as simple as writing an addition equation to describe a situation. In middle grades, a student might apply proportional reasoning to plan a school event or analyze a problem in the community. By high school, a student might use geometry to solve a design problem or use a function to describe how one quantity of interest depends on another. Mathematically proficient students who can apply what they know are comfortable making assumptions and approximations to simplify a complicated situation, realizing that these may need revision later. They are able to identify important quantities in a practical situation and map their relationships using such tools as diagrams, two-way tables, graphs, flowcharts and formulas. They can analyze those relationships mathematically to draw conclusions. They routinely interpret their mathematical results in the context of the situation and reflect on whether the results make sense, possibly improving the model if it has not served its purpose.\" (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010, p. 7)      Use appropriate tools strategically.  \"Mathematically proficient students consider the available tools when solving a mathematical problem.

Proficient students are sufficiently familiar with tools appropriate for their grade or course to make sound decisions about when each of these tools might be helpful, recognizing both the insight to be gained and their limitations. For example, mathematically proficient high school students analyze graphs of functions and solutions generated using a graphing calculator. They detect possible errors by strategically using estimation and other mathematical knowledge. When making mathematical models, they know that technology can enable them to visualize the results of varying assumptions, explore consequences, and compare predictions with data.

By paying attention to the calculation of slope as they repeatedly check whether points are on the line through (1, 2) with slope 3, middle school students might abstract the equation . Noticing the regularity in the way terms cancel when expanding , , and might lead them to the general formula for the sum of a geometric series. As they work to solve a problem, mathematically proficient students maintain oversight of the process, while attending to the details. They continually evaluate the reasonableness of their intermediate results.\" (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010, p. 8)          One of the challenges teachers face is helping students connect the Content Standards using the Standards for Mathematical Practice . How do we go about eliciting student thinking about mathematics and engaging them in productive struggle where they can gain experience using these 8 practices? In the next subsection, we will take a look at some ways to accomplish this by trying to identify elements of these standards within our own mathematical exploration. Throughtout this text, we will also watch video cases and read written vignettes where actual secondary students are grappling with both mathematical content and practices. We will analyze these situations and build our own instincts as teachers to better engage our future students in mathematical development.    Applying the Common Core State Standards  In this section, we will focus on identifying and applying the Common Core State Standards within mathematical tasks and classroom cases. To begin, we can start by examining a task that involves both mathematical content and mathematical practices with a goal of identifying aspects of the CCSS in relation to our reflections on what we do and why we do it. As a teacher, it is essential that we continually assess and evaluate our students' thinking. This allows us to make adjustments in our instruction to meet the needs of young learners. Novice teachers can practice this process by participating in metacognitive activities. Metacognition , often described as \"thinking about your own thinking,\" is the awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes. It's a higher-level cognitive skill that allows individuals to plan, monitor, and evaluate their own learning and problem-solving. Consider the following task.    Roadkill   Consider a problem in many rural areas roadkill. As you drive along the highway, I am sure you have noticed deer carcasses in the ditch. Deer collisions are a common cause of insurance claims and vehicles have evolved to try and reduce the number of deer incidents. Some cars have sensors that alert the driver to a potential object in the road and can even engage the brakes. So how does the technology make decisions on how to brake if an object is detected? It is not practical to slam on the brakes if the object is still a fair distance away. However, if the object is closer, the vehicle may need to decelerate more quickly. How fast can a vehicle decelerate safely without harming the occupants? These questions can be answered by a series of calculations that relate distance, rate, and time. In this activity, you will explore a simple model for dealing with this question. Consider the problem posed in the video below.     Roadkill Activity      Before actually tackling the Roadkill task, in your group, develop a strategy for how you will approach the task. Don't begin trying to solve it yet, just develop a strategy and summarize it on your whiteboard to share with others.    Share your strategy for attacking the problem and listen to others' approaches. On your whiteboards, summarize your thought on the following questions. What are some pros and cons of each approach? How are the approaches the same? How are they different?    Now carry out your plan. Remember, I will place the deer in front of your Rover at an unknown location and you will have to then enter a time into the Rover to try and get as close to the deer as possible without hitting it. The team with the closest approach will get a prize.     In his book, Building Thinking Classrooms in Mathematics (2020), Peter Liljedahl discusses types of tasks and their effectiveness for engaging students in thinking as opposed to mimicking. He refers this type of task as a \"highly engaging thinking task\". These are tasks that are so engaging that people cannot resist thinking. They have broad appeal and can be used across a wide range of grades (e.g. upper elementary, middle, high school, Calculus and beyond). Now let's take a look at what you experienced in solving the Roadkill problem and relate it to the CCSS and Liljedahl's ideas of tasks.    Roadkill: Revisited   In class, we used the TI-Innovator Rover to avoid hitting a deer and developed strategies using an inquiry approach. This task (as I am sure you have discovered) involves mathematics. For this reflection, read through the Common Core State Standards (which also happen to be the Michigan Standards). As stated before, the Standards have two components (Standards for Mathematical Content and the Standards for Mathematical Practice). For this assignment, read through the Grades 5-8 and the High School Standards.    Identify items found in the middle and high school portion (Grades 5-8 and the High School portion) for the Standards for Mathematical Content of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics that are directly related to this task. As you list the standards, give a brief description of each and explain how your experience with the Rover might help you teach the given standard.    Are the content standards you listed in part (a) dependent on the approach a group may have taken?    Are the content standards you listed in part (a) related to each other in any way? Describe any connections you see.    As you think about this task, how might it be used in a middle grades (grades 5, 6, 7, or 8) classroom? What tools would you expect students in these grades to use to tackle this task?    As you think about this task, how might it be used in a lower level high school (Algebra, Geometry, or Integrated) classroom? What tools would you expect students in these classes to use to tackle this task?    As we have seen, there are many different mathematical concepts that could potentially be identified by students when a teacher enters a whole class discussion where students share their approaches. What would you do if a student (or group) suggests an approach that leads to a mathematical concept that you had not planned to adress with your lesson? Discuss ideas in your groups and be ready to share with the class.    Identify items found in the Standards for Mathematical Practice that are directly related to these experiences. As you list the standards, give a brief description of each and explain how your experience with the Rover might help you address the given standards when working with students.  Liljedahl categorizes highly engaging thinking tasks into the three following types:      Low-Floor Task : Task with a threshold that allows any and all learners to find a point of entry, or access, and then engage within their level of comfort.     High-Ceiling Task : Tasks that have ambiguity and\/or room for extensions such that students can engage with the evolving complexity of the task.     Open-Middle Task : A problem structure where a task has a single final correct answer, but in which there are multiple possible correct ways to approach and solve the problem. (Liljedahl, 2020)       How would you categorize the Roadkill Activity? Give some reasoning for your categorization. Do you think it could be considered for more than one type?    While this activity uses robotic Rovers to engage students in looking at relationships, you might be tempted to say, \"But when I go to teach, I won't likely have Rovers...How can I use this activity? I knew this class would be a waste.\" Well, I like to think that We All Use Math Every Day ! When I walk through a toy aisle of a store, I am always thinking, \"How can I use that toy to teach math?\". To get you thinking, you have in front of you a toy car that can be pulled back to engage a spring so that it moves forward when released. In your groups, devise a plan to teach some of the same mathematical concepts you identified in Roadkill using this cheap car. Summarize your ideas on the whiteboards and be prepared to share with your colleagues.     The Commonn Core State Standards have been a topic of debate by partents and teachers alike. Many parents become frustrated when they struggle to help their children with homework. One example that made its way around the internet was a parent (who claims a degree in engineering) having difficulty helping with subtraction. The curriclum has children use a number line to solve the problem by moving along the number line. The parent expresses frustration since he thinks the children should just line up the digits and use the \"standard\" algorithm that he was taught (see for a summary). One of the reasons for parental frustration is that many parents simply memorized or mimicked procedures without connecting it to the meaning of the algorithm and therefore the alternative methods being taught do not make sense to them.     Common Core Frustration Explained    What is interesting about the method explained in is that while angry parents complain about this \"new\" method, it is actually not \"new\" at all. This is actually how my grandmother learned it. This method called \"counting on\" or \"cashier's subtraction\" stems from an era where electronic cash registers did not exist and cashiers actually \"counted back\" a patron's change. In fact, from a practical sense, people with an understanding of arithmetic do not usually line up digits and subtract. Counting on is a much easier way to mentally compute a difference. Otherwise, people generally pull out their phone and use their calculator app. I once received free frozen yogurt because a cashier could not make change. His cash register locked up and he could not rely on it to tell him how much change to give me. I tried to walk him through counting on, but instead, he simply gave my wife and me free frozen yogurt and locked the door behind us as we left, closing up for the night.  As we work through this course, it is essential that the preservice teacher try to make sense of the Common Core State Standards and always ask the question, \"Why do we teach this concept and how can I help students make sense of it?\". Reducing mimicking in favor of thinking is the key and as teachers we should always strive for thinking over mere procedural fluency.   "

Noticing the regularity in the way terms cancel when expanding , , and might lead them to the general formula for the sum of a geometric series. As they work to solve a problem, mathematically proficient students maintain oversight of the process, while attending to the details. They continually evaluate the reasonableness of their intermediate results.\" (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010, p. 8)        "

  "body": " Roadkill   Consider a problem in many rural areas roadkill. As you drive along the highway, I am sure you have noticed deer carcasses in the ditch. Deer collisions are a common cause of insurance claims and vehicles have evolved to try and reduce the number of deer incidents. Some cars have sensors that alert the driver to a potential object in the road and can even engage the brakes. So how does the technology make decisions on how to brake if an object is detected? It is not practical to slam on the brakes if the object is still a fair distance away. However, if the object is closer, the vehicle may need to decelerate more quickly. How fast can a vehicle decelerate safely without harming the occupants? These questions can be answered by a series of calculations that relate distance, rate, and time. In this activity, you will explore a simple model for dealing with this question. Consider the problem posed in the video below.     Roadkill Activity      Before actually tackling the Roadkill task, in your group, develop a strategy for how you will approach the task. Don't begin trying to solve it yet, just develop a strategy and summarize it on your whiteboard to share with others.    Share your strategy for attacking the problem and listen to others' approaches. On your whiteboards, summarize your thought on the following questions. What are some pros and cons of each approach? How are the approaches the same? How are they different?    Now carry out your plan. Remember, I will place the deer in front of your Rover at an unknown location and you will have to then enter a time into the Rover to try and get as close to the deer as possible without hitting it. The team with the closest approach will get a prize.   "

Liljedahl categorizes highly engaging thinking tasks into the three following types:      Low-Floor Task : Task with a threshold that allows any and all learners to find a point of entry, or access, and then engage within their level of comfort.     High-Ceiling Task : Tasks that have ambiguity and\/or room for extensions such that students can engage with the evolving complexity of the task.     Open-Middle Task : A problem structure where a task has a single final correct answer, but in which there are multiple possible correct ways to approach and solve the problem.

While this activity uses robotic Rovers to engage students in looking at relationships, you might be tempted to say, \"But when I go to teach, I won't likely have Rovers...How can I use this activity? I knew this class would be a waste.\" Well, I like to think that We All Use Math Every Day ! When I walk through a toy aisle of a store, I am always thinking, \"How can I use that toy to teach math?\". To get you thinking, you have in front of you a toy car that can be pulled back to engage a spring so that it moves forward when released.

  "body": " Elementary Concepts of Number     Scientific Notation from CCSS for 8th Grade       Abby's Lesson on Scientific Notation   Abby is teaching scientific notation as part of her 8th grade curriculum. You can see the details from the Common Core State Standards 8.EE #4 as given in . She begins by discussing the process for converting back and forth between numbers written in standard Hindu-Arabic form and those written in scientific notation.   Abby : Today we are going to look at another way to write numbers when they become so long that we really don't need to use all of their digits. When a number gets so big, the digits closest to the units really don't matter so much. Suppose you are Elon Musk and you decide to buy a new jet. The jet costs $200,000,000. Further suppose Mr. Musk is currently worth roughly $412 billion. After the purchase of the jet, how much is Elon Musk worth? Yes, Kate.   Kate : $411.8 billion?   Abby : Good, but let's just keep it in whole billions.   Kate : OK, $412 billion?   Abby : Nice! So did his purchase really matter much when it come to his wealth? Toby?   Toby : Not at all. That's like me worrying about fifty cents.   Abby : So what we are going to talk about today is called scientific notation and it's used when numbers are so big that we don't really need to worry about all the digits. Suppose we are looking at the number 372400. Instead of writing all of the digits, we can instead write it as a power of 10. If move the decimal point to the left until it is between the 3 and the 7 and count how many places we move it [ Abby writes the number placing the decimal point at the far right and then draws curved half circles under the digits to indicate movement of the decimal point from place to place, counting as she goes ], we can use the number of places we move it as the power of 10. This means that . So you just need to count the moves.   Mia : Why are the moves the same as the power of 10?   Abby : That's just how we write the new notation to shorten it. Let's try another example for a really big number. That might help. How would you write 5,681,000,000,000 in scientific notation? Yeah, Ja'miya.   Ja'miya : Well, I guess we'd just count to get it between the 5 and 6, so let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. So twelve. So would it be ?   Abby : Great. Does that help, Mia?   Mia : Not really. I'm still not sure why the power of ten is the same as counting the moves.   Abby : Well, let's just practice a few more and see if that helps.   Mia rolls her eyes and starts talking to her group mates.     Individually, describe what you think are the central issues involved in the classroom exchange.    In your groups, share your thoughts about the classroom dialogue and come up with a list of things you think went well and not-so-well.    In light of our class discussions, how would you handle the same situation in your classroom? Give specific examples to illustrate what you would do.    In the vignette, Mia seemed to be frustrated that her question was being ignored. What do you think are the main mathematical concepts involved in the classroom discussion? How are place value and scientific notation connected?    Discuss how the connection between place value notation and scientific notation are related to Pirie and Kieren's construct of “folding back”.     As you may have noticed in the vignette, Mia became frustrated because her question about why the process Abby was describing worked was being ignored. In order to teach mathematics, we much have a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts so that we do not resort to procedural approaches to teaching out of our own lack of understanding. To this end, let's dive a little deeper into numeration and number systems and explore why we write numerals as we do.  Throughout mathematics, humankind has found the need to expand its numeration systems. While some cultures developed symbol systems to represent the concept of number, others relied (and still rely on) linguistic representations. For example, some studies suggest that the Pirahã tribe in Brazil have a limited system consisting of just \"one\", \"two\", and \"many\". Scholars are still debating this tribe's concept of number, but one might ask, why only three words for numbers? As we examine the concept of number, it is important to realize that number is usually tied to a culture. Imagine a culture where people possess very few things. If there is no need to keep track of possessions, why invent a number representation to express them? If very few people have more than two of anything and there is no need to compare quantities, why bother? \"Many\" should suffice. Throughout history, we will see that the expansion of a number system is usually triggered by a necessity for describing amounts or quantities.  Another distinction we need to make is the difference between a number and a numeral . In society, these words are often used interchangeably, but they have quite different meanings. A number is a concept or property. For example, the fingers on my hand have a property of \"fiveness\". If I count them, I can place them in a one-to-one correspondence with the words {one, two, three, four, five}. Both of these sets share a property of \"fiveness\". Any other set that can be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with these sets (fingers or words) can be said to have the property of \"fiveness\" and thus we say that there are \"five\" things in the set. Here five is a number concept. In contrast, \"5\" is a symbol that we use to represent the concept of five. I guess, the word \"five\" is also a symbol (or collection of symbols) that we use to represent the concept of five. This is the distinction between number and numeral. A number is a concept while a numeral is a symbol that is used to denote the concept. This will become a more important distinction later when we look at how we develop symbolic meaning in an algebraic sense.    Elementary Whole Number Systems  One of the earliest numeration systems was the tally system or what we like to call the WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) system. In this system, simple tally marks represented a number. For example, suppose you had seven bags of grain. In the tally system, the person would represent their possessions as |||||||. As you can imagine, this would be fine if you had little, but if you had many possessions, it would quickly become cumbersome. The Egyptians developed a way of eliminating the need for tally marks by inventing new symbols to represent groups of objects. In this case, the Egyptians grouped by ten (probably due to the fact that people had ten fingers and when counting on fingers, to keep track, they would need to begin again on the first hand after counting to ten). Once they collected ten of something, they created a new symbol to represent a bundle of ten. Once ten of those bundles were gathered, they created another symbol to represent ten bundles of ten and so on (see ). This way, to write a numeral, they would never need to have any more than nine of any symbol. They used the following symbols to represent various powers of ten.    Egyptian Numeral System     With each different symbol, the Egyptians could now write larger numbers using a more condensed collection of symbols than in a tally system. For example, suppose we wish to express the number 31,254. In our Hindu-Arabic system, we allow each space to represent a different power of the base (ten in this case). Thus, expressed in expanded base-ten notation. The Egyptians, on the other hand, did not use the spatial location of the symbols to convey the specific power of the base, but rather they created a different symbol for each power (size bundle). Therefore, the number 31,254 would be written as    Egyptian Numeral for 31,254     Although this system was a great improvement over the tally system of numeration, it doesn't take long to see a major drawback. Since each new power of the base requires a new symbol, expressing larger and larger numbers becomes cumbersome. In order to express any given positive integer, the Egyptian system requires an infinite number of symbols.     Consider the following numerals written in our standard Hindu-Arabic system.    Write 7,521 in the Egyptian system.    Write 582,346 in the Egyptian system.    Write 2,141,425 in the Egyptian system.     So how do we improve on the problem of needing to create new symbols for each power of ten (or any base for that matter)? The ancient Babylonians developed a place-value system for representing any positive integer using a finite number of symbols. The Babylonians used the position of the symbol or collection of symbols to represent the power of the base (in this case a base sixty system which meant that in any single position, the symbols could total at most fifty-nine). Although they bundled in groups of sixty, they had only two symbols along with a place holder to be used for when there were no bundles of a certain power of the base (see ). The early Babylonians did not use the place holder, but the confusion caused by not being able to indicated easily when there were no bundles of a certain size necessitated the creation of a symbol to \"hold an open space\". The Babylonians did not have a fully functioning zero, but the place holder provided a way to indicate no bundles of a specific size by its location in the string of symbols.    Babylonian Numeration Symbols     To illustrate, consider the expanded base sixty notation as written using our familiar Hindu-Arabic numerals. Here we have . And so the early Babylonians would write this number as     The problem was in how this numeral could be interpreted. Did this collection of symbols mean or ?  To make this expression less ambiguous, the placeholder was used to express the meaning more clearly. Thus the later Babylonian system would write the intended number as     As we shared before, although the use of the placeholder serves the same role as our zero in the Hindu-Arabic system, the Babylonians did not recognize the concept of zero as being a number representing nothing.     Consider the following numerals written in our standard Hindu-Arabic system.    Write 1,422 in the Babylonian system.   How many bundles are there of size , , , etc.?    Write 1,123,426 in the Babylonian system.   How many bundles are there of size , , , etc.?    Write 147,637 in the Babylonian system.   How many bundles are there of size , , , etc.?    Write the following Babylonian numerals as Hindu-Arabic base-ten numerals.    Babylonian Numeral      Babylonian Numeral       The ancient Mayan civilization were probably the first to fully recognize the concept of zero. The Mayans also used a place-value numeration system. In this case, their grouping number was twenty. They actually had a pseudo base twenty system since their place values progressed as: . The reason for the deviation from was due to their calendar that had 18 months with 20 days per month ( ). Like the Babylonians, the Mayans had very few symbols. The difference is that the Mayans had a symbol for zero (or nothing) represented by an empty oyster shell. This was different from the Babylonians in that the Mayan's symbol was not just a placeholder, but rather was a symbol representing nothingness. The symbols are given below.    Mayan Numeration Symbols     Like the Babylonians, the position of the collection of symbols determined the power of the base. However, unlike the Babylonians, the Mayan base is not exactly uniform. Instead of a base twenty system, they used a pseudo-base twenty system . The reason for this is that the base was tied to their calendar year. The Mayan calendar contained 18 months each containing 20 days. The result was a 360-day year. This can be seen below by the replacement of the normal place value, , with the place value of . After this, the place values simply increase the power of 20 by one for each successive place. The Mayans wrote the numerals vertically with the higher powers of the base above the lower powers and the symbol for zero was used as a placeholder. Within a single place value location, the unit dots would be written above the horizontal bars that each represented five. For example, the number , in Hindu-Arabic would be written as     To this point, civilizations had focused mainly on representing the natural or counting numbers, . The Mayans extended this system to include zero , often referred to as the whole numbers . Some texts include 0 in the set of natural numbers and refer to the counting numbers as the positive integers, denoted . Thus, the use of seems to be less ambiguous since zero is neither positive nor negative and so we will use .  With the advancement of a place-value system, cultures evolved to use different symbols for each face value (i.e. the symbols used to represent the number of any particular sized bundle). These symbols were dependent on the base (or bundle size) that was used. For example, in our current commonly used base system, (base ten), we have ten symbols since once we get ten of anything, we bundle them and we create another bundle of the next place value space. For base six, there would be six symbols. For base, there would be three symbols, and so on. Therefore, in base ten, we have the symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The symbols used here are the Hindu-Arabic numerals (not to be confused with Arabic numerals) used on many Middle Eastern countries (see ). Both use a base-ten place-value system.    Arabic vs Hindu-Arabic Numerals     An interesting fact is that even though Arabic is written right-to-left, the numerals are still written left-to-right. This is due to the fact that the symbols were adopted from India where language is written left-to-right. This means that while reading text, you would read right-to-left until reaching a numeral and then switch to left-to-right for the number and then switch back to right-to-left as you continue to read the text. Again, this shows how mathematics and language are both culturally connected. Below ( ) is a picture of a license plate from Iraq from 2025. This would be read as 656874 in our Hindu-Arabic symbols. Iraq was in the process to switching to the use of the Western Hindu-Arabic numerals at the time and this is an older plate that had not yet been replaced.    Arabic License Plate (photo credit Noah Lapp)        In this activity, we will explore how different bundling sizes impact the way numerals are used to represent a whole number. In and you see videos that show how place value is used to express the number \"twenty-three\". Notice that we use the English term \"twenty-three\" here since the number \"twenty-three\" will look different as a collection of numerals or digits depending on how we decide to bundle.    Begin by counting out forty-three bundling sticks. Form as many bundles of ten as you can and record the number of bundles of size ten along with any remaining sticks left unbundled using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.    Bundling By Ten    Bundles of Ten  Leftover Units                                                                                We can use expanded base-ten notation to write 43 as:  ______________   ______________  Write a base ten numeral for this amount: _________________________    Starting over with the same forty-three bundling sticks. Form as many bundles of eight as you can and record the number of bundles of size eight along with any remaining sticks left unbundled using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.    Bundling By Eight    Bundles of Eight  Leftover Units                                                                                Write a base eight numeral for this amount: _________________________    Starting over with the same forty-three bundling sticks. Form as many bundles of six as you can and record the number of bundles of size six along with any remaining sticks left unbundled using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If you get six bundles of six, form a \"super bundle\".    Bundling By Six    Six Bundles of Six  Bundles of Six  Leftover Units                                                                                                        Write a base six numeral for this amount: _________________________    Starting over with the same forty-three bundling sticks. Form as many bundles of five as you can and record the number of bundles of size five along with any remaining sticks left unbundled using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If you get five bundles of five, form a \"super bundle\".    Bundling By Five    Five Bundles of Five  Bundles of Five  Leftover Units                                                                                                        Write a base five numeral for this amount: _________________________    Based on your responses from the earlier part of this activity, we can say that the same forty-three sticks can be expressed as:     ___________ ___________ ___________         Using Bundling Sticks to Represent Twenty-Three       Using Base Blocks to Represent Twenty-Three       Consider the following set of blocks (often referred to as Dienes Blocks after the Math Educator, Zoltan Dienes). If you do not have physical blocks, you can use the interactive applet in .    Base Ten Blocks (aka Dienes Blocks)       Virtual Base Ten Blocks       If a unit represents 1, what does a flat represent? What does a long represent? What does a block represent?    If a long represents 1, what does a flat represent? What does a block represent?    Let a unit represent 1. Using combinations of blocks, flats, longs, and units, how would you represent:  237 ____________________________________________  400 ____________________________________________  2,314 ____________________________________________  502 ____________________________________________  Give two ways of representing 31.    Let a unit represent 1. Take 12 units. If you consider each unit, long, flat, and block as one object, how could you represent the same number with the fewest number of objects? (e.g. one long, two flats, and one unit make up 4 objects).    Let a unit represent 1. Take 13 units, and 14 longs. If you consider each unit, long, flat, and block as one object, how could you represent the same number with the fewest number of objects?    Represent 274 with Dienes blocks. You need ____________ blocks, ____________ flats, ___________ longs, and _____________ units.  Represent 1741 with Dienes blocks. You need ____________ blocks, _____________ flats, ___________ longs, and _____________ units.  Place these sets of objects together. This represents the sum . Before regrouping, you now have___________ blocks, ____________ flats, ___________ longs, and _____________ units.  Does this immediately give the base-10 representation of the sum? Explain.  Make appropriate trades to get the base-ten representation of the sum. What is ?  Did you have to know any \"addition facts\" to solve this problem with Dienes blocks? Explain.     Again, one of the reasons we do not want children to simply recognize a collection of symbols as representing a single number is that it masks the meaning behind how our numeration system is expressed. We must first expect children from an early age to form bundles of varying sizes and count how many of each there are before then translating this into symbols used to represent the number. Jerome Bruner, the noted learning theorist, suggested that children must go through three main phases in order to understand representations: Enactive , Iconic , and finally Symbolic . In the enactive stage, the students \"do\" something to act out a process or concept. The iconic stage consists of students producing images that are raw representations of the process or concept. These representations usually lead to limitations requiring a refinement into more abstract symbolic representations. By experiencing these stages in order, meaning is attached to the symbols so that students can understand what they are symbolizing as opposed to just memorizing without meaning. Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno's (2008) model is an extension of this theory and we will discuss their mechanisms for transition among these phases later when we look at algebraic concepts. For now, we can see an example of an elementary teacher engaging Kindergartners in Bruner's theory in the video in .     Kindergartners Learning Base-Ten Place Value       Now that you have watched the video excerpt from the Kindergarten class, let's analyze the classroom exchange in greater detail with respect to Bruner's theory on concept development with respect to the stages of: Enactive , Iconic , and Symbolic .    In your groups, discuss the goal the teacher has as he introduces his \"ten friend\" at time stamp 2:23. How does he engage the students and what stage of Bruner's model is the teacher using?    At time 2:32, one student blurts out, \"It's like a ten frame\", referring to a grouping frame that the students have used to place single unit cubes into a bundle of ten when using their manipulatives. What aspect of Pirie and Kieren's model is the student using?    At time 3:19, the same student who commented about the ten frames, states, \"Oh, you added\". When we think about the work we have done in , where do you think the teacher might go with this comment when the class begins using symbols\/digits to express expanded base-ten notation? How would you express 11 in expanded base-ten notation ?    At time 4:15, the teacher asks Jalen to go up and make the total value 14, but then quickly changes his thought to 12. In your groups, discuss why you think the teacher made this sudden change.    As the students form different numbers using the \"Ten Friends\" and \"One Friends\", notice that the teacher holds his hand over the objects as the children respond. What do you think the teacher is trying to accomplish by this gesturing?    At 7:00 into the lesson, the teacher has students pick up 4 \"Ten Friends\" and 4 \"One Friends\" to then determine the number 44. Discuss in your groups why it might have been better for the teacher to have asked the students grabbing \"One Friends\" to grab an amount other than 4.    At 8:28, a student shares, \"I get it now.\" and the teacher then presses for an explanation. In explaining, the student states, \"Always the biggest number goes first and the little ones goes last\". The teacher then re-voices the student's comment to clarify what he meant by \"biggest\" meaning not the number of an object (since both were 4), but rather the size of grouping. Based on this student's comment, do you think the students have experience writing numerals on paper? Explain your reasoning.    The teacher has the students form 35 using the manipulatives and at 9:35 he points as the students count, first by tens. However, before continuing the counting of the ones, the teacher pauses. Why do you think the teacher chose to pause?    At the end of the lesson, the teacher has the children get scissors, glue, pencils, and a clipboard. To what stage in Bruner's model is the teacher transitioning? In your groups, discuss what you think the teacher will have the students do next along with the purpose of each of the tools: scissors, glue, pencils, and clipboard in the activity. How is this related to Bruner's stages of development?     You may have noticed the children in the previous video excerpt \"folding back\" on their prior expereinces as they began to make connections between the \"Ten Friends\" and \"One Friends\" in physical sense and the numerals they have already experienced in their daily lives. So what does this mean for the students in Abby's class from the earlier vignette at the beginning of this section? To wrap up this subsection, consider the following revisit to Abby's class.    Abby's Lesson on Scientific Notation-Revisited   Recall that in Abby's class, Mia becomes frustrated because her question about why the process Abby is teaching works. Mia is desparately trying to make sense of the algorithm, but is not able to connect it to her previous experiences in a satisifying way. Now that we can express numbers in expanded base-ten notation , let's think about how the mathematics might help Abby address Mia's concern.    Let's look at the same number from the vignette, or . In your groups, use your whiteboards to write the number as a sum of four whole numbers or fractions where each digit is represented by one of the four terms in your sum.    Using your sum from part (a), use the distributive property and multiply your sum by , expressing your result still as a sum of four terms. Explain how your new representation is connected to the expanded base-ten notation that you used in . How might Abby have used this idea to help Mia grasp the connection between what she already knew (folding back to place value) and the algorithm Abby was teaching?    Abby wants students to be able to move back and forth between scientific notation and standard notation for numerals. What questions might Abby ask to reverse your distributive property from part (b) to go from a numeral in standard base ten notation to scientific notation? If the number in scientific notation is expected to be given in a certain number of significant digits, how would Abby deal with the undesired digits once they have expressed the number as a sum with fractions? Discuss how \"significance\" might be an appropriate word here when thinking about the fractions and Toby's comment from the vignette. How is a fractional representation helpful when it comes to a digit's insignificance?       Extension of the Number System to Integers  As time went on, the need arose to represent the concept of debt. Since cultures had created the whole numbers and a way to represent them, they again chose to extend the current number system to accommodate the need to represent quantities that were the \"opposite\" of the positive integers. Thus, the accepted set of numbers became the integers , denoted .  However, operations on these negative numbers were still looked at with skepticism. For example, what does it mean to multiply two negative numbers? Adding a negative to a positive had some meaning since the debt model would mean that some of the positive value would be cancelled by the negative values. Multiplying a negative by a positive value also had some meaning since if we owe three people $10, then it makes sense that . But what about multiplying two negative numbers? Consider the video in .     Using a Pile-and-Hole Model for Integer Multiplication       In the video in , we looked at a pile-and-hole model where piles of sand represented positive values and holes represented negative values. When a pile comes in contact with a hole, we get level ground (i.e. zero). In this activity, we will explore this idea using two different colored chips (one color for positive and one color for negative). Using these chips, with blue as positive and red as negative, respond to the following questions.    With the chips, form the numbers and . If you place a blue chip on top of a red chip, this is equivalent to placing a pile into a hole. Combine a blue chip with a red chip for as many chips as you can. If the red and blue combinations represent a filled hole (aka zero), what is the numerical result of the remaining chips? What addition problem does this represent?    With the chips, form the numbers and . Again, combine a blue chip with a red chip for as many chip that you can. If the red and blue combinations represent a filled hole (aka zero), what is the numerical result of the remaining chips? What addition problem does this represent?    When we begin to examine multiplication, let's begin with \"level\" ground (i.e. zero). With the sand example, if we wanted to represent , we began with flot sand and \"created\" three sets of two holes (the first number represents creating or placing and the second number represents the object that we are creating or placing). The result was that we had six holes meaning that the result was . For this question, with your chips, act out the multiplication . Explain the meaning of your result.    With your chips, act out the multiplication . Remember that the first number represents the act of creating or placing objects and so a negative value would need to represent the act of removing objects. Also, you need to begin with zero. Explain the meaning of your result.   To begin with zero and still have piles to \"remove\", what must you also have so that you begin with a \"flat\" surface (i.e. zero)?    With your chips, act out the multiplication . Remember that the first number represents the act of creating or placing objects and so a negative value would need to represent the act of removing objects. Also, you need to begin with zero. Explain the meaning of your result.   To begin with zero and still have holes to \"remove\", what must you also have so that you begin with a \"flat\" surface (i.e. zero)?     As convincing as our pile-and-hole model may seem from a physical manipulative perspective, it should not seem too surprising that negative numbers had not been widely accepted for many years since reasoning by analogy can give us insight, but it hardly constitutes abstract proof. Mathematicians were still very skeptical of negative numbers even in the 1700s (this is around the time of the founding of the USA). This is really not that long ago. In fact, in 1770 Euler used basic properties of the number system to show the product of two negatives is positive. His proof is really not that involved and can be followed by most middle school students familiar with the properties of additive and multiplicative identities, additive inverses (i.e. \"opposites\"), the distributive property of multiplication over addition, and the zero product property (see ).    Euler's Proof that the Product of Two Negatives Is Positive   The product .    Consider that , since is the additive identity. This now leads to the fact that since and are additive inverses. But, as is the multiplicative identity. The distributive property now allows us to factor out from the first two terms of this expression giving . Since , this leads to . Finally, since the product of any number and is , this shows that and as is the additive idenity, we get . Since this line of reasoning began with , we have shown that .       Rational and Irrational Numbers  Eventually, there was a need to represent quantities that were smaller than a whole unit (for a fun cartoon see below) and so the rational numbers again extended the known set of numbers. To the Greeks, all quantities could be expressed as the quotient of two integers and so the rational numbers, denoted , came to be the accepted system of numbers.     The Weird Number       Take a square piece of paper and fold it along one edge into thirds (fold it like a formal letter that you are putting into an envelope). Now unfold the square and using the side adjacent to the side you just used to fold it into thirds, fold it in half and then fold it into half again (essentially folding into fourths).    Highlight along the \"thirds\" edge, two of the three segments along that direction (this represents 2\/3 of the unit length).    In a similar manner, highlight along the \"fourths\" edge, three of the four segments along that direction (this represents 3\/4 of the unit length).    Shade the entire rectangle formed by the two edges that you have just shaded. What does this area represent?    How many small rectanlges have you shaded? Where does this number come from with respect to the two fractions that they represent (2\/3 and 3\/4)?    How many total small rectanlges are there in your original square? Where does this number come from with respect to the two fractions that they represent (2\/3 and 3\/4)?    If you were to express the fraction of small shaded rectangles as compared to the total number of small rectangles in the square, how would you state it?  There are ____________________ out of ____________________ small rectangles that are shaded.    Explain how you would express the statement from part (f) as a fraction.    Based on your observations, give a process that could be used for multiplying fractions.        Think back to when you learned to add whole numbers during elementary school.    In your groups, discuss how you recall \"adding\" sets of objects in, say, Kindergarten. What did you do with the objects?    As you think about your response to part (a), how would you describe the objects you \"added\"? Were they treated the same in terms of the counting or differently?    With respect to Pirie and Kieren's model, what would be some primitive knowing concepts that might be used to begin thinking about \"adding\" rational numbers?    In thinking about the video, The Weird Number , would all slices of cake be treated equally when \"counting\" them or are some slices treated differently when trying to \"add\"? Consider the number of slices in the portion of cake stolen by that scoundrel versus the number of slices stolen by .    In your groups, discuss why non-integer rational numbers need to have the same denominator in order to add them.     When Pythagoras' work suggested that the hypotenuse of a right isosceles triangle with legs of length 1 could not be represented as the quotient of two integers (see ) and therefore, his work was considered heresy. According to Pythagoras, if and are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle, then their relationship to the length, , of the hypotenuse was, . So if , then this would say that . However, would then need to be a rational number if all numbers must be rational (according to the Greeks at the time). The problem is that if we make this assumption, we get a contradiction (see ).    Isoceles Right Triangle with Legs of Length 1       Irrationality of    The is not rational.    (By contradiction) Suppose is rational. Then there exist such that where and have no common divisors except 1 (i.e. is in lowest terms). Then and thus . Since , this implies is even. If is even, then must also be even because if were odd then would be odd as well.  Therefore, let for some . By substitution, and so . Dividing by 2 we get and thus is even (has 2 as a factor) and therefore is also even. But and were assumed to have no common divisors except 1. Since and we have a contradiction and so must be irrational.  Note that this proof can be replicated for for any prime, .     Eventually, these irrational numbers such as became accepted by the mathematical community and thus the current number system of the time was again extended to include both rational and irrational numbers. This set of numbers formed by the union both of these sets is called the real numbers , denoted . Other well-known irrational numbers include transcendentals such as and .

  "body": " Abby's Lesson on Scientific Notation   Abby is teaching scientific notation as part of her 8th grade curriculum. You can see the details from the Common Core State Standards 8.EE #4 as given in . She begins by discussing the process for converting back and forth between numbers written in standard Hindu-Arabic form and those written in scientific notation.   Abby : Today we are going to look at another way to write numbers when they become so long that we really don't need to use all of their digits. When a number gets so big, the digits closest to the units really don't matter so much. Suppose you are Elon Musk and you decide to buy a new jet. The jet costs $200,000,000. Further suppose Mr. Musk is currently worth roughly $412 billion. After the purchase of the jet, how much is Elon Musk worth? Yes, Kate.   Kate : $411.8 billion?   Abby : Good, but let's just keep it in whole billions.   Kate : OK, $412 billion?   Abby : Nice! So did his purchase really matter much when it come to his wealth? Toby?   Toby : Not at all. That's like me worrying about fifty cents.   Abby : So what we are going to talk about today is called scientific notation and it's used when numbers are so big that we don't really need to worry about all the digits. Suppose we are looking at the number 372400. Instead of writing all of the digits, we can instead write it as a power of 10. If move the decimal point to the left until it is between the 3 and the 7 and count how many places we move it [ Abby writes the number placing the decimal point at the far right and then draws curved half circles under the digits to indicate movement of the decimal point from place to place, counting as she goes ], we can use the number of places we move it as the power of 10. This means that . So you just need to count the moves.   Mia : Why are the moves the same as the power of 10?   Abby : That's just how we write the new notation to shorten it. Let's try another example for a really big number. That might help. How would you write 5,681,000,000,000 in scientific notation? Yeah, Ja'miya.   Ja'miya : Well, I guess we'd just count to get it between the 5 and 6, so let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. So twelve. So would it be ?   Abby : Great. Does that help, Mia?   Mia : Not really. I'm still not sure why the power of ten is the same as counting the moves.   Abby : Well, let's just practice a few more and see if that helps.   Mia rolls her eyes and starts talking to her group mates.     Individually, describe what you think are the central issues involved in the classroom exchange.    In your groups, share your thoughts about the classroom dialogue and come up with a list of things you think went well and not-so-well.    In light of our class discussions, how would you handle the same situation in your classroom? Give specific examples to illustrate what you would do.    In the vignette, Mia seemed to be frustrated that her question was being ignored. What do you think are the main mathematical concepts involved in the classroom discussion? How are place value and scientific notation connected?    Discuss how the connection between place value notation and scientific notation are related to Pirie and Kieren's construct of “folding back”.   "

At time 2:32, one student blurts out, \"It's like a ten frame\", referring to a grouping frame that the students have used to place single unit cubes into a bundle of ten when using their manipulatives. What aspect of Pirie and Kieren's model is the student using?    At time 3:19, the same student who commented about the ten frames, states, \"Oh, you added\". When we think about the work we have done in , where do you think the teacher might go with this comment when the class begins using symbols\/digits to express expanded base-ten notation? How would you express 11 in expanded base-ten notation ?    At time 4:15, the teacher asks Jalen to go up and make the total value 14, but then quickly changes his thought to 12. In your groups, discuss why you think the teacher made this sudden change.    As the students form different numbers using the \"Ten Friends\" and \"One Friends\", notice that the teacher holds his hand over the objects as the children respond.

Mia is desparately trying to make sense of the algorithm, but is not able to connect it to her previous experiences in a satisifying way. Now that we can express numbers in expanded base-ten notation , let's think about how the mathematics might help Abby address Mia's concern.    Let's look at the same number from the vignette, or . In your groups, use your whiteboards to write the number as a sum of four whole numbers or fractions where each digit is represented by one of the four terms in your sum.    Using your sum from part (a), use the distributive property and multiply your sum by , expressing your result still as a sum of four terms. Explain how your new representation is connected to the expanded base-ten notation that you used in . How might Abby have used this idea to help Mia grasp the connection between what she already knew (folding back to place value) and the algorithm Abby was teaching?    Abby wants students to be able to move back and forth between scientific notation and standard notation for numerals. What questions might Abby ask to reverse your distributive property from part (b) to go from a numeral in standard base ten notation to scientific notation? If the number in scientific notation is expected to be given in a certain number of significant digits, how would Abby deal with the undesired digits once they have expressed the number as a sum with fractions? Discuss how \"significance\" might be an appropriate word here when thinking about the fractions and Toby's comment from the vignette. How is a fractional representation helpful when it comes to a digit's insignificance?   "

Using these chips, with blue as positive and red as negative, respond to the following questions.    With the chips, form the numbers and . If you place a blue chip on top of a red chip, this is equivalent to placing a pile into a hole. Combine a blue chip with a red chip for as many chips as you can.

  "title": "Extending the Number System: Complex Numbers",
  "body": " Extending the Number System: Complex Numbers   Throughout history, our number system has evolved primarily driven by necessity. It should come as no surprise that our current system (the complex numbers) was also driven by an issue with the real number system. One of the motivators was the search for real solutions to equations, in particular, polynomial equations. The solution to the general quadratic equation, , had beeen established as but there was still some concern for the situation when a negative appeared under the radical. Putting these negative square roots aside, the usefulness of the real solutions found with the quadratic formula was considered a leap forward.  In 1494, Luca Picioli published his volume, Summa de Arithmetica , where he examined linear and quadratic equations. However, there was still a search for a solution to the general cubic, . At the time, the solution to some forms of the cubic had been found. For example, Scipione del Ferro had found a way to solve the \"depressed\" cubic (meaning one without the squared term) of the form, , but the general cubic was still out of reach and Picioli did not have high hopes that a solution to the general cubic could be found. In his work, Picioli began to experiment with more symbolic notation using the symbol, co , to denote a variable (here co was short for cosa , Italian for \"thing\" or \"thing to be found\"), and was a leap forward in compressing notation so that ideas could be expressed in a smaller visual space reducing the number of words used in formalizing mathematical arguments. We will address the importance of compressed expressions with respect to Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno's (2008) model for the development of symbolic meaning later, but for now, it suffices to say, mathematics was on the verge of significant advancement.  Scipione del Ferro had kept his discovery for finding a solution to a secret as was often the practice of the time, since academic appointments were not very secure and mathematicians could be \"dethroned\" from their positions by being challenged. Upon his death, he passed his solution to his student, Antonio Fior. Now Fior was not nearly as good of a mathematician as del Ferro, but was a bit more brash. Fior began challenging mathematicians since he knew all he had to do was give them depressed cubics that only he alone knew how to solve and he would be the victor. As fate would have it, Fior chose to challenge the Brescian scholar, Niccolo Fontana. Now Fontana was a brilliant mathematician, but was disfigured by the sword of a French soldier as a child and his deformity caused him to speak with a stammer. He was therefore more commonly known by the cruel epithet, Tartaglia (The Stammerer). Well, Tartaglia began to attack Fior's challenge of 30 depressed cubics, but had not made much progress. As the time to submit his final solutions approached, on February 13, 1535, he had a breakthrough and discovered the solution to the depressed cubic, , defeating his challenger.  Now that Tartaglia had mastered the depressed cubic, another brilliant mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano, sought an audience with Tartaglia in hopes of learning the solution to the depressed cubic. Tartaglia refused to reveal his secret, but after many other attempts at persuasion, Tartaglia finally relented with the caveat that Cardano would not reveal or publish the solution. Cardano gladly accepted the terms.  Enter the young 20-year-old mathematician, Ludovico Ferrari. Ferrari approached Cardano asking for work and they soon forged a partnership. With their collaboration, Cardano found a way to depress the general cubic, , into one of the form, . However, Cardano's dilemma was that in order to publish his solution to the general cubic, he would then need to use Tartaglia's solution for the depressed cubic and he had vowed not to reveal it.  Stymied by his moral dilemma, in 1543, Cardano and Ferrari went to Bologna to explore the works of del Ferro. To their surprise, they found that del Ferro had actually written down his original solution to the depressed cubic, prior to Tartaglia discovering it. Since he could now state that he got the solution to the depressed cubic from del Ferro and not Tartaglia, Cardano was now free to publish the solution to the general cubic. When his work, Ars Magna was published, it was earth shattering news to the mathematical community.    Depressing the Cubic   So how did Cardano do it?    Enter the general cubic, , on your CAS. Now using the \"such that\" key, |, make the substitution, and expand the result. Is there a \" \" term? Can you put the result into the form?    Well, it worked for the cubic. What about the quadratic? Enter the general quadratic, , on your CAS. Now using the \"such that\" key, |, make the substitution, and expand the result. Is there a \" \" term?    Well, it worked for the quadratic and cubic. What about the quartic? Enter the general quartic, , on your CAS. Now using the \"such that\" key, |, make the substitution, and expand the result. Does this process continue to work?     So now you are wondering, how is this historical trip relevant to complex numbers? As it turns out, using Cardano's process for finding solutions to the general cubic, at stages of the process, the pesky number, , shows up. However, when continuing the process, we can have the resolved by squaring and thus obtain real solutions in the end. So in order to obtain real solutions to the general cubic, mathematicians had to \"tip-toe\" through the imaginary, , and this was uncomfortable. With the quadratic formula, we could just ignore the messy since those solutions weren't real anyway, but here, we have to put up with to arrive at real solutions. Mathematicians could no longer simply turn a blind eye, but had to face that such numbers must exist.    Complex Numbers and the Common Core State Standards  The secondary school curriculum includes the teaching of complex numbers even though some aspects of this are not required for all students graduating from high school. Note that the Common Core State Standards denote this with a (+) symbol next to those topics not expected for all students. However, all secondary teachers must be expected to teach these concepts and certainly any student planning to enter scientific fields should be expected to leave high school having exerpience with complex numbers. Below in are the standards from the CCSS with regard to complex numbers.    Complex Numbers Standard from CCSS     “When will I ever teach this?” You most likely have uttered this statement while taking undergraduate mathematics courses as part of your teacher preparation program. The purpose of this section is to highlight examples of where the secondary mathematics curriculum and the undergraduate mathematics curriculum are inextricably connected. To begin this discussion, we may want to brush up on some mathematical ideas on which a teacher tasked with teaching complex numbers may rely. The Core-Plus curriculum is counting on connections and is designed to take advantage of a variety of mathematical concepts as the complex number system is explored.    Preliminary Connections to Complex Numbers     To start, examine the On Your Own problem at the end of Investigation 1 , from the fourth year text of Contemporary Mathematics in Context: A Unified Approach found on page 385 of book 4B. It is restated below for your convenience in .    Core Plus On Your Own Item, Book 4B, p. 385     In addition, there is a companion question at the end of Lesson 2 on Polynomials and Factoring found on page 402 (see ). This question states:    Core Plus On Your Own Item, Book 4B, p. 402     Give responses to the following questions before discussing them within your group. After you have provided individual responses to the questions, spend approximately 15 minutes discussing your answers within your group and record any changes or modifications to your original responses on your whiteboards along with brief elaborations on why you may or may not have modified your responses.    What do you consider to be the relevant mathematical concepts involved in the exploration?    Describe how you think content from each of the undergraduate courses (Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Discrete Mathematics) might be relevant to this investigation.       Jan's Class and Jeff's Question   Now that you have started to reflect on the mathematics and pedagogy present in these explorations, consider the following classroom situation where a teacher (Jan) is questioned by her students.  Jan has been teaching polynomials and factoring out of Lesson 2 of the Contemporary Mathematics in Context: A Unified Approach (Core-Plus) curriculum. She assigned students to work on the “On Your Own” question found on page 385 of book 4B as well as the “Extending” questions found on pages 402-403 (see and ). During the next class period, she facilitated a discussion of the homework assignment. Within the discussion, Jeff asked, “I was able to do the error function graphs and I understand that the longer the polynomial, the closer we get to matching the sine function, but how did they come up with those polynomial functions? They all have weird coefficients and stuff.”    Explain how you would respond to Jeff's question. Keep in mind that Jeff is in his fourth year of high school mathematics and has been exposed to the concept of derivative earlier in book 4A.    When we describe the shape and behavior of various functions, we often pay attention to features such as zeros, y-intercepts, slope, intervals of increasing\/decreasing, concavity, etc. Of these features, which do you consider to be the most relevant to Jeff's question?    Describe what type of investigation you might give your students to help them discover the strategy for constructing appropriate polynomials that imitate the sine function. Be very specific and include actual questions you would give the students for investigation.     Depdending on when you are taking this course, you may or may not have completed Calculus 2. In order to have productive conversations about this classroom scenario, we should take a moment to either examine or brush up on some content from Calculus 2. In this next activity, we will revisit some of these main concepts, so if you have already been exposed to an activity such as this, please don't spoil it for others and humor me by playing along and not squash the potential discoveries of your peers.    Impersonating Functions   This activity explores basic concepts of algebra and calculus involved in using power series to imitate transcendental functions. In particular, the series for , , and are investigated and connections are made with practical uses of such functions for creating computing algorithms used by calculators and computers to evaluate numerical approximations.  Have you ever wondered how your calculator knows what the or the is or how it can find decimals for numbers like ? Did someone program every possible square root, trig value, or logarithm into the machine? Wouldn't that take up a tremendous amount of memory? Well, the answer is that your calculator knows how to use basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to approximate these types of values to the desired decimal accuracy. In this exploration you will first investigate how we can approximate more complicated transcendental functions using simple polynomials. Once we establish this method for approximating functions with polynomials, we will then use it to explore a surprising connection between trigonometry and the complex number systems.  To this point we have seen that if we zoom in far enough, a function looks a great deal like a straight line. But how does this help us impersonate more complicated functions like ?    Graph along with several possible linear functions that would look like the “linear-looking” graph of when you zoom in near . Remember, you need the linear function to have the same slope as and also have the same point in common with at zero. Record the lines you tried along with brief explanations for why you tried those particular lines. Give your final line that you feel best imitates at .    Now that you have created a line that looks similar to near , graph it along with on the same window. Zoom out and give an approximation of the interval about where your line is a “fairly close” imitation of .    Suppose you want to imitate within a larger interval. Since is not linear, we need a function that curves so that it will “hug” the graph of through a larger interval. Since quadratics are curved, experiment with your linear function from part (a) by adding on a term of the form . Record your choices for along with sketches of your new quadratic function and on the same axes. Give your final choice of quadratic function of the form that best imitates near .    You have now been able to extend the size of the interval where can be imitated by a polynomial by adding on a higher degree polynomial term. Can this continue? Take the quadratic function you have developed in part (c) and try to extend the interval of imitation further by adding on a third-degree term and experimenting with its coefficient. Give your final choice of cubic function of the form that best imitates near and sketch your graph of along with your cubic.    The polynomials you have created to imitate the function are called Taylor polynomials named for the mathematician, Brook Taylor. To understand why these particular coefficients work for imitating this function (as Jeff in vignette was asking), let's look at one other function ( ) and imitate it using a built-in command on your CAS. On most CAS, the command has similar syntax. On Maple, we use ; to get a seventh degree polynomial that mimics near zero. On a TI-Nspire CX CAS, the syntax is where the 0 at the end is the point near where you want to imitate the function and the is the variable you would like used in the polynomial (if you omit the value about which you want to imitate the function, it assumes a value of 0). On the TI-Nspire CX CAS you can find the command under the submenu of the menu.  Use your CAS's Taylor command to generate 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th degree Taylor polynomials for and record them in a table like the one in . Graph all of these along with on the same axes.    Odd Degree Polynomials for       Now in order to understand why these particular polynomials work, let's examine the 9th degree polynomial that you have found. As you learned in Calculus 1, we can infer information about the “shape” of a graph by looking at the derivative. More specific, the first derivative tells us the slope of the function at a given point, the second derivative tells us the rate at which the slope is changing, the third derivative tells us the rate at which the rate of the slope is changing and so on. With each higher order derivative, we gain more information about the “shape” of the graph and its behavior. This is the idea behind Taylor polynomials.  To explore this relationship, complete the following table where you evaluate the derivatives of both your polynomial and at . Record them in a table like the one in and state your observations related to your results.    Odd Degree Polynomials for       Now find the 8th degree Taylor polynomial for using your CAS's Taylor command. Repeat what you did in part (f). Record your results in a table like the one in and state your observations related to your results.    Odd Degree Polynomials for       Using your observations from parts (f) and (g), state a conjecture about the derivative of a Taylor polynomial and the derivative of the function it is imitating. Then test your conjecture with the 3rd degree Taylor polynomial for you found earlier.    In the special case of near zero, use your Taylor command to generate polynomials of degree 5, 6, 7, and 8 for . Describe the pattern you see for the general degree Taylor polynomial for .    Recall from Calculus 1, for . Explain how this fact is related to your results from the derivative of your general Taylor polynomial for .    The fact that we can create polynomials to imitate the functions , , and is extremely important from a practical sense. Have you ever wondered how your calculator knows the value of something like ? The operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are basic algorithms that exist as routines in any computer or calculator (note that exponents can be accomplished using repeated multiplication). If we wish to know , the machine can simply create a finite polynomial that imitates the sine function to the desired decimal accuracy and then compute it using these basic binary operations that make up the polynomial.  Now suppose you have only a non-scientific calculator (without sine, cosine, and tangent keys) and need to evaluate where the argument for sine is in radians. Explain how you could accomplish it? What about ? What about ?     Many who begin a teacher preparation program often have a misconception that since they have experienced mathematical content as a learner, teaching it simply consists of telling students what you have already learned yourself. As I was preparing to be a teacher, this was also my naïve position. When I first started to prepare lessons and act them out with my peers, I soon realized that I had not really internalized the mathematics deeply enough to respond to interesting questions posed by my fellow pre-service teachers. But I would just dismiss it at first by justifying it as, \"these are my peers, so that's not such a big deal. I am going to teach high school students, not my peers who were already in undergraduate courses with me\". However, observing both in field placements and videos of actual classrooms, I saw high school students asking really interesting questions for which I had no reasonable response. In my field placements, typically the teacher would skirt the issue and tell the student to just follow the steps they had been shown leaving the students frustrated.  As time went on, I began to realize that the reason the teacher avoided these questions was because, like me, they did not fully grasp the mathematics that they were teaching. This expereince motivated me to try to do more than memorize the procedures I was being taught, but rather to connect ideas. This actually helped me to reduce what I needed to commit to memory since I could retrieve information better once it was connected to other concepts. For this reason, we should now reflect on our mathematical experience and connect it to your earlier responses to Jeff's question in the classroom scenario.    Jan's Class and Jeff's Question-Revisited   Now that we have explored the concepts in Impersonating Functions ( ), we should revisit the classroom situation from Jan's class . This time, try to view the classroom exchange through the lens of undergraduate mathematics. In particular, try to relate your experiences from Impersonating Functions to how you would respond as a teacher to Jeff's question.    In light of your experience in our activity, Impersonating Functions , describe the central mathematical concepts involved in addressing Jeff's question.    Describe how your facilitation of the rest of the classroom discussion would change from how you responded earlier in based on your experiences in Impersonating Functions . Give specific examples to illustrate what you would do in guiding the students and how these pedagogical choices have changed from your earlier responses.       Complex Connections: Applications to the Classroom  One of the important skills as a teacher is the ability to take specific curriculum and modify or add to it to make connections for your students. In this section, we will spend some time examining the structure of a specific set of curriculum materials and reflect on how you might make classroom decisions to take advantage of connected mathematics content in light of your own understanding of the mathematics you learned as an undergraduate. In this case we will use the secondary curriculum Contemporary Mathematics in Context: A Unified Approach (Core-Plus) as a springboard for discussion.  Recall the classroom situation presented in . There, Jan had been teaching polynomials and factoring out of Lesson 2 of the Contemporary Mathematics in Context: A Unified Approach (Core-Plus) curriculum and she assigned homework related to the use of polynomials for imitating functions such as . Your task here is to explore Lesson 2 from Unit 6, Polynomials and Factoring, as well as Lesson 4 from Unit 7, and explain how making appropriate pedagogical decisions could help connect the topics involved.     Read through the Lesson 2 from Unit 6 of the Contemporary Mathematics in Context: A Unified Approach (Core-Plus) curriculum, book 4B (pp. 382-405). You will notice that the lesson is broken up into three investigations ( Need for Speed , Strategic Factors , and A Complex Solution) .    The overall purpose of the lesson seems to center around the idea of using polynomials in various forms to model situations and even imitate more complicated functions such as . Discuss in your groups why you think the investigation, A Complex Solution , was included in this lesson.    As you will recall from the discussion in , Jeff had asked a question regarding the origin of the polynomials that were being used to imitate the function . Also note that this occurred within Lesson 2 of Unit 6. In addition, this particular lesson also sees the first time complex numbers are introduced within the Core Plus curriculum. Now that you have examined the entire lesson from this unit, explain any connections that you see between complex numbers and the use of polynomials to imitate the sine function.     Many teachers (and the general population for that matter) often think that the text book they use \"is\" the curriculum. It is important to realize that this is not the case. For example, we have already explored the Common Core State Standards which is the document for many states (like Michigan) that define the curriculum. Local school districts can expand on these standards as well giving teachers more detail for what is to be covered. However, the text itself, is not the curriculum, but rather a tool for delivering the curriculum much like other tools such as graphing calculators or computer software are tools. One of the tasks of a teacher is to take a curriculum that is being used and help their students connect ideas even if the curriculum does not explicitly do it.     Read through Lesson 4 from Unit 7 of the Contemporary Mathematics in Context: A Unified Approach (Core-Plus) curriculum, book 4B (pp. 494-507). In this lesson, the concepts surrounding complex numbers are expanded from their earlier introduction in Lesson 2 of Unit 6. In particular, the trigonometric form of complex numbers, , is discussed. In question 3 of the “Reflecting” section (p. 504), Euler's formula, , is stated and the students are expected to evaluate expressions using it; however, there is no treatment of the origin of Euler's formula. As a teacher, your job is to help students make connections between their earlier experiences in Unit 6 and their current experiences in Unit 7.  In addition, consider the following dialogue from Jan's earlier classroom situation where she is has taught (Lesson 2, Unit 6) is now teaching the content from Lesson 4 of Unit 7. She had assigned the questions from the “Reflecting” section of Lesson 4 (pp. 504-505) as homework. During the next class session, the following discussion occurred.   Jan : How did the homework go? Does anyone have questions?   Dan : When I got to question 3, I wasn’t sure where that to the theta thing came from?   Jan : Oh, that's just Euler's formula. The mathematician Euler came up with that a long time ago.   Dan : But I don't get where he got it.   Liz : I had the same sort of question. Isn't a real number?   Jan : Yes, it is.   Liz : Then how can you raise a real number to a power and get a number that's not real? That doesn't make sense. Didn't we say that if you multiply any two real numbers together, we get another real number? Like isn't real?   Jan : Yes, is real.   Liz : But if powers are just repeated multiplication, then why wouldn't to any power be real?   Dan : Yeah, I couldn't figure that out either.   Jan : But the power in is not real. So it can end up having an imaginary part.   Ken : But where did Euler get this thing? How did he figure out that ?   Jan : Well you'll just have to take my word for it right now. Euler used mathematics that you can't understand yet. You'll need to wait until you take more math before you can start to understand that.  With these situations in mind, in your groups, discuss and respond to the following questions.    Describe any connections you see between the content of Lesson 2 of Unit 6 and Lesson 4 of Unit 7.    Discuss your reaction to Jan's response to her students. In particular, how would you have handled the situation? Keep in mind that just as in , these students are in their fourth year of high school mathematics and have been exposed to the concept of derivative earlier in book 4A.       A Complex Situation   Now that we have established how Taylor series can be used to impersonate other more complicated functions, we can look at connections to complex numbers and try to address Ken's question from Jan's classroom exchange. The authors of the Core-Plus curriculum are counting on these connections and their materials reflect this thoughtful design. One of the goals of integrated curricula like Core-Plus or IMP is to impart to the students that mathematics is not simply a collection of procedures to be memorized and performed, but rather a linked web of ideas and concepts that make sense when we look at them from a holistic perspective. To this end, we now examine how ideas from calculus, algebra, and geometry come together to give a more solid picture of complex numbers.     A Complex Situation: Addressing Ken's Question   At the end of the classroom exchange from Jan's lesson, Ken asked the very understandable question, \"But where did Euler get this thing? How did he figure out that ?\". However, Jan's response of, \"Well you'll just have to take my word for it right now. Euler used mathematics that you can't understand yet.\" may not be entirely accurate. In this activity we explore how the use of Taylor polynomials can help Ken explore a surprising connection between trigonometry and the complex number systems. During the next activity, we will want to use the interactive sketch found in below.    Complex Plane with , , and       Recall from , we noticed that we can mimick the three transcendental functions, , , and by using the polynomials:     At this point, you may have noticed similarities among the three polynomial expansions that imitate the three transcendental functions: , , and . Describe any connections you see among the terms for these polynomial expansions.    Using the first six terms for each of the polynomial expansions of and , write out an expression for the approximation to .    Now using the substitution of in the polynomial expansion , write out the first twelve terms. On the TI-Nspire CAS you can do this by simply using the \"such that\" key entering after the expression for the Taylor polynomial you found for . Describe any patterns you see among the three polynomial expansions for , , and . Did this substitution help remedy any differences you noticed in part (a)? Explain.  Notice that the result you found in part (c) is a number that has both a real and an imaginary part. The terms that are similar to the polynomial for sine have the imaginary number attached by multiplication.  In this case we think of a complex number of the form as a point in the complex plane where the real part is plotted along the horizontal axis and the imaginary part is plotted along the vertical axis. As in the case of the relationship between rectangular and polar coordinates, we can also think of the same point defined by the rectangular form as also defined by an angle and a radius. For example, we can take the complex number and express it as the point in the complex plane located at a distance of 1 from the origin and at an angle of since . Although these are both helpful ways to represent complex numbers, is there another way that is even simpler?  Now considering the fact that we can express any complex number in the polar form, as you observed in part (c), what is the practical significance of your discovery? We will now investigate the relevance of this observation to basic operations on complex numbers.    As seen in , the complex numbers, , , and are sketched in the complex plane. Note that you can simply edit the real and imaginary components of and for each complex numbers on the left or drag them around. You are not able to drag since it is defined as the product of and and thus is dependent on them. The measure of the three angles are given on the left along with the magnitude for each of these complex numbers. Consider the two complex numbers, and as given in the figure. Explore the relationships among , , and by manipulating and . Describe any patterns that you notice.    Now express each of the numbers, , , and in polar form, . Do the results of the polar form agree with your observations from your sketch of the numbers plotted in the complex plane part (d)?    Noting the magnitude and angle of the three complex numbers, move by dragging it on the complex plane. What do you notice about the change in the angle and magnitude of as compared with the change you observed with ? Try the same process with and note the relationships between the angle and magnitude changes of . State your observations in the form of a conjecture.    Given your result from part (c), provide a simple explanation for the pattern you have just noticed in parts (d), (e), and (f) by expressing each complex number, , , and as a single exponential term of the form .       Pulling Things Together: Basic Geometry   Just as the Greeks were wary of numbers such as , mathematicians were also cautious when it came to the solutions of equations like . It did not seem conceivable to have a number that when multiplied by itself could yield a negative number. In fact, negative numbers themselves were still suspect and even though Euler had shown that the product of two negatives was a positive (see ), mathematicians were not quite ready to deal with the interpretation of a negative number. Nonetheless, as we noted before, when Cardano was able to come up with real solutions to the general cubic equation, , by tiptoeing through solutions to intermediate equations where existed, interest grew in regard to this weird number, .   Although the imaginary number has become accepted and used to extend the real numbers, , to the complex numbers, , how do we as mathematicians come to understand this set? Before we delve deeper into the ways in which the complex numbers help us connect various branches of mathematics, let us first have a brief review of how complex numbers can be viewed and the representations associated with their understanding.  Summarizing what we have discussed thus far, you will recall that our numeration system has evolved from the basic counting numbers, to the whole numbers, , to the integers, , to the rational numbers, , and finally the real numbers, . As we have seen, . So how do the complex numbers fit into this scheme? We would like to have an extension of our real numbers so that . In order to extend the real numbers, if we allow the imaginary numbers to simply augment the real numbers by adding on an imaginary part to a real number such as where and are real numbers, then we can reduce the complex numbers to real numbers by simply using the special case where to generate the real numbers. Therefore we obtain the following definition.     The complex numbers are the set of all numbers of the form where and are real numbers and . Note that if , we have the set of real numbers and so .     Now that we have a definition, how do we make sense of these numbers? Until the complex numbers came along, all was fine. We could think of the whole numbers as the cardinality of sets of objects. When negative numbers came on the scene, we could understand them through a process of “taking away” from sets of objects. As we progressed to rational and irrational numbers, we invoked a measurement model (the number line) to describe all of the previous types of numbers. But how then do we interpret complex numbers?  If we take a closer look at the various parts of a complex number, we can gain some insight into how to represent them. Since a complex number, , is made up of “coefficients” and that are real numbers, why not use the model that has worked for real numbers, the number line? The only problem is that we now have two real numbers associated with a given complex number. So which one do we use? The solution is to use both. Why not think of a complex number as an ordered pair of real numbers. This would imply that we can plot a complex number in a coordinate plane using as the  along one axis and as the  along the other axis since . As a result, we can think of a complex number, , as a point in the plane.    Perpendicular \"Number Lines\" for Describing     One advantage to this representation is that when we consider the real numbers as a subset of by setting , from a graphical perspective, the plane is reduced to the real line and thus we have a consistent representation for the real numbers using a measurement model. In addition, from a linear algebra perspective, we can also view complex numbers as vectors and thus the vector space, , can be thought of as isomorphic to and as a subspace of .  If we can think of the complex numbers as a plane, can we have different representations of these numbers from an algebraic standpoint? As you may recall from high school, we can graph points with real coordinates in either a Cartesian or polar form. Just as we can define a point by two numbers representing a position along the and axes, we can also define the same point by an angle, , and a radius, . To illustrate this, consider the unit circle in .    Complex Plane with Defined by Angle and Distance     The position of the point in the complex plane along the unit circle can be described by the angle and radius (in this case ). If we wish to see the relationship between the Cartesian and polar representations, we simply use the trigonometric relations to see that and (see ).    Complex Number on the Unit Circle     If the complex number is not confined to the unit circle, we can represent it by multiplying by the radius, , yielding . In this way we can describe any point in the complex plane as in .  When we extend our number system representing them as points in a plane, concepts like absolute value become more interesting. How do we interpret the concept of absolute value for complex numbers? One of the beautiful things about mathematics is its logical consistency. When it comes to absolute value, we should expect nothing less. Recall that our concept of absolute value for real numbers is linked to a relationship of distance on the real number line. For the real numbers, is just the distance of from 0 on the number line. Why not adopt a similar concept for the absolute value of a complex number. In this case, instead of the position of 0 on a line, we invoke the analogous point for a plane. Therefore we define the absolute value or modulus of a complex number, , as the distance of from the origin of the complex plane, denoted by .  If we think of , then by the Pythagorean theorem where and represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. We often refer to the complex numbers that lie on the unit circle in the complex plane as the set, . Therefore . The angle, , of the vector for is called the principal angle or sometimes the principal argument of and expressed as . We will explore this set of complex numbers later when we look at orbits of complex numbers.  Our next question is how do we compute with complex numbers? Is our definition of these numbers consistent with or geometric view of complex numbers as being represented by points in a plane? For addition, due to commutativity and the distributive property. How does this play out geometrically? Consider the addition of two vectors in the complex plane.    Two Vectors in the Complex Plane     Adding these vectors geometrically, we get    Adding Two Vectors in the Complex Plane     Since we add vectors head-to-toe , the geometric representation is consistent with the algebraic representation through standard vector addition.  Now we can turn our attention to multiplication. Again, using the basic commutative and distributive properties, we would suspect that and since , we get   What geometric properties can we expect from this consequence and how do they fit with our earlier observations? To explore the geometric interpretation of this product, let us consider the polar forms of these complex numbers where              With this in mind, making the appropriate substitutions we get     Noticing that the product appears in each term we can simplify this to     This tells us that the product in some way involves the product of the two moduli, and . But how are the angles of the original complex numbers and the resulting angle of the product related? Consider the two components of the product, and . Do these look familiar? If not, open your old Calculus or Trigonometry text and investigate. From our basic trigonometric identities, we see that     and     Using these identities, we get     Thus, the modulus of the product of two complex numbers is the product of the moduli for the original two numbers and the argument of the product is the sum of the arguments. In other words,     and     Or in other words, if is the angle of the product, , then .    Seeing Connections: Taylor Series   As we have seen through the use of trigonometric identities, finding the product of two complex numbers expressed in polar form is simply a matter of multiplying the moduli and adding the arguments and then using the cosine and sine of the new arguments. But is there an easier way to represent complex numbers so that the need to find trigonometric values of the arguments is not necessary? At this point, we will examine what you discovered in the activity, A Complex Situation ( ), and apply it to work with complex numbers.   You may recall from Calculus that when we wish to model exponential growth mathematicians and scientists often use functions of the form, even though our first experiences with such phenomena usually involve the concept of doubling. For example, as teachers, we often introduce exponential growth through examples like:   A population of ducks doubles every 13 years. If the population of ducks currently numbers 45, how many ducks would you expect in the population in 26 years?   Using this type of example to introduce exponential growth, one might expect to model the growth using a function of the form rather than . It is not until we begin the study of Calculus that we can grasp the reason for using . Recall that and so for the special case where , this derivative simplifies to . Therefore it is advantageous to use the natural base, , instead of a base like 2. In a similar manner, we find creeping back into the representation of complex numbers as well.  Consider the result you found in , A Complex Situation . In particular, consider the relationship     This suggests that any complex number can be expressed in the form . We should take a moment to mention that a treatment of the convergence of complex series is necessary here, but for the time being we will assume these series converge. Thus if we consider any two complex numbers and , then the product is given by     yielding the same conclusion found using trigonometry. In this case, results from Calculus find an interesting way of influencing the representations we might choose to use for complex numbers. If you have ever asked yourself why a high school teacher needs to take so much mathematics beyond what is taught in the high school, this is one example of how understanding the relationships among various areas of mathematics might influence pedagogical choices made in the classroom.    Orbits of Complex Numbers   Just like the real numbers, the complex numbers have a structure that allows for the solution of equations by using basic properties. We will expand on these later when we address the concept of a group within the context of abstract algebra, but for now it suffices to say that just like the real numbers under multiplication, there exists an identity element that when multiplied by any number leaves it alone. For example, consider . Here the number 1 is acting as the identity element. When it comes to solving equations, this is an important idea since if we can get the coefficient of a variable to be 1, we can basically ignore it. Consider the equation, . If we can only find a way to make the coefficient of a 1, it for all practical purposes can be ignored the variable is then alone on one side of the equation leaving us able to simply read off the solution. But how can we \"make\" the coefficient a 1? We can't just change it. Well, the key is to exploit a relationship between an identity element and an inverse element . Basically, an inverse is an element (or number in this case) that when combined with a number using the operation (multiplication in this case) yields the identity . In the case of our equation, , we need a number that when multiplied by 5 gives 1. The number, , works here as is the multiplicative inverse of .  The use of this relationship between identities and inverses is the key to solving many problems including puzzles like Rubik's Cube and thus permeates all of mathematics. For our example, we simply multiply by on the left on both sides of the equation and we get   The next natural question is if complex numbers have the same relationships? In the following activity, we will explore these properties with complex numbers by looking at orbits of complex numbers.     Orbits of Complex Numbers   For this activity you will need the file Orbits.tns for the TI-Nspire CX II CAS . Consider the following set of complex numbers, , with the operation of multiplication shown below and defined on page 1.1 of the document. Be certain that your Document settings allow appropriate viewing of complex numbers.       Does every element have an inverse? Recall that two elements are inverses if when combined they give the identity as a result (in this case for multiplication, 1). Make a list of all elements and their inverses provided they have one.    For each element in the set , find the first power you must use to give a result of 1. Here you may want to use the algebraic capabilities of the spreadsheet to quickly check. For example, below we see the use of the Lists and Spreadsheet page to quickly produce the powers of the element, . Here the first time to a power gives the result of 1 is for the exponent 4.    Using a Spreadsheet to Generate Powers       Now using the element, , what elements of can you express as a power of ? List each of these elements and their corresponding power of .    Using your observations from part (c), explain the relationship that exists between the powers of for each element of and the corresponding power of for each element's inverse.  Consider the elements of the set defined above. Recall that using Taylor series we derived Euler's equation, , and saw that from a geometric standpoint all complex numbers of the form can be expressed in polar form as where is the length of the vector representation of the complex number and is the angle of the vector with respect to the positive x-axis.    Complex Plane      For the element , find the corresponding values of and and represent in the form where .    Discuss the relationship between the product of any two complex numbers and the original two complex numbers themselves. In particular, what relationships exist between the length and angle of the product when compared to the lengths and angles of the two original complex numbers?   Note what happens when you multiply and .     Using the polar representation for that you found in part (e), give the polar form for all elements in by using the relationships you discussed in part (f) and sketch each of these elements as vectors on the complex plane below (be sure to label each).    Complex Plane      How many solutions are there to the equation and how do the elements in relate to this?  In the earlier questions we were dealing with complex numbers whose vector had length 1 and all were on the unit circle in the complex plane. But what would happen if the length of the vector representing a complex number was something other than 1? To explore this, start with the Calculator page 2.1 of the document and store the complex number from the earlier questions above in the variable, . On page 2.2, the powers of any complex number stored as on the Calculator page are graphed in the complex plane. Here you should see the “orbit” of the 8th roots as you sketched them in question (g). See .     Orbit of a Stored Complex Number   Orbit of a Stored Complex Number      Explain why these resulting complex numbers all fall on the unit circle.    Now choose another complex number with length (modulus) less than 1 and store it in . An easy way to enter such a number is to use the polar form where . Sketch the resulting orbit of your complex number. Explain the behavior you see by relating it to what you know about products of complex numbers.    Now choose another complex number with length (modulus) greater than 1 and store it in . An easy way to enter such a number is to use the polar form where . Sketch the resulting orbit of your complex number. Explain the behavior you see by relating it to what you know about products of complex numbers.    Explain when the orbit of a complex number will spiral outward and when it will spiral inward.     As a special case of the multiplication of complex numbers, consider the powers of a complex number. Based on the results we have seen in thus far, we can state the following.     Let be any complex number and let . Then .     What does this theorem say about the sequence in the complex plane? To begin, let us look at an example such as . Graphing the successive powers of in the complex plane we get the following spiral.     Orbit of Spiral Out   Orbit of     Now consider the complex number, . Here the successive powers yield a different kind of spiral.     Orbit of Spiral Out   Orbit of     Why does one of these produce an outwardly spiraling pattern while the other produces an inward spiral? Consider the consequences of . As we go from one power to the next, the point in the complex plane rotates by the initial angle (in this case, ). In addition, the modulus becomes successive powers of the original modulus. In the case of which is greater than 1, the sequence of the successive modulus will increase without bound. In the case of which is less than 1, the sequence of successive modulus decreases and converges to 0. What would happen if the original complex number appeared on the unit circle? You explored this question in . Because of this spiraling pattern, this sequence of powers of a complex number is called the orbit of the complex number.     Let . The set is called the of .     One of the applications of orbits of complex numbers is in determining roots. For example, suppose we want to find all of the 7th roots for the complex number, . We can also express this as since . If we consider a 7th root of , call it , to have the property that , then we know that its modulus must end up being . By , this means that the modulus of must be and must have rotated six times to arrive at the . In other words, we need     However, this is not the only equation that will do what we wish. Since we are dealing with periodic functions, we could equally solve the equation     The geometric relationship here can be seen by examining the orbits for these solutions. Consider the following orbits for shown below. These graphs utilize a polar graphing mode defining and graphing the x-coordinate as and y-coordinate as for and . They also use a connected line to show the progression from one power to the next. The geometric representation for each value of shows the rotation about the origin by the same angle for successive powers and an elongation of the modulus finally ending at the complex number, when raised to the 7th power. Since the angle that is being used for the rotation is of the form , you will notice that as increases, the size of the angle rotation between successive powers also increases.    Orbit zk k0      Orbit zk k1      Orbit zk k2      Orbit zk k3    By examining the geometric representation, we now have a visual perspective for how works in the determination of roots.     Show that if a quadratic with real coefficients has a complex root with an imaginary part, then it must have two complex roots with imaginary parts.    Suppose , the unit circle in the complex plane. Show that the product, .    Suppose, and , what can you say about the modulus, ? Explain why the term, “units”, is used to describe the set .    Use proof by induction to prove .    Let . Using , explain the behavior of the familiar sequence for . In other words, explain why we get the alternating signs when and only positive numbers when .    Given a complex number, , explain how you would find its additive inverse. You should use both algebraic and geometric representations to justify your strategy.    Given a complex number, , explain how you would find its multiplicative inverse. You should use both algebraic and geometric representations to justify your strategy.    Using the polar graphing capabilities of your CAS, graph the orbit of showing at least 10 points in the orbit.    Explain why there can be no more than distinct, roots of unity for complex numbers.    Use what you know about the geometry of complex numbers to find all of the roots of unity.    Use what you know about the geometry of complex numbers (behavior of magnitudes and angles) to find the multiplicative inverse of . Explain your reasoning for how you created the inverse.    "

She assigned students to work on the “On Your Own” question found on page 385 of book 4B as well as the “Extending” questions found on pages 402-403 (see and ). During the next class period, she facilitated a discussion of the homework assignment.

  "body": " Impersonating Functions   This activity explores basic concepts of algebra and calculus involved in using power series to imitate transcendental functions. In particular, the series for , , and are investigated and connections are made with practical uses of such functions for creating computing algorithms used by calculators and computers to evaluate numerical approximations.  Have you ever wondered how your calculator knows what the or the is or how it can find decimals for numbers like ? Did someone program every possible square root, trig value, or logarithm into the machine? Wouldn't that take up a tremendous amount of memory? Well, the answer is that your calculator knows how to use basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to approximate these types of values to the desired decimal accuracy. In this exploration you will first investigate how we can approximate more complicated transcendental functions using simple polynomials. Once we establish this method for approximating functions with polynomials, we will then use it to explore a surprising connection between trigonometry and the complex number systems.  To this point we have seen that if we zoom in far enough, a function looks a great deal like a straight line. But how does this help us impersonate more complicated functions like ?    Graph along with several possible linear functions that would look like the “linear-looking” graph of when you zoom in near . Remember, you need the linear function to have the same slope as and also have the same point in common with at zero. Record the lines you tried along with brief explanations for why you tried those particular lines. Give your final line that you feel best imitates at .    Now that you have created a line that looks similar to near , graph it along with on the same window. Zoom out and give an approximation of the interval about where your line is a “fairly close” imitation of .    Suppose you want to imitate within a larger interval. Since is not linear, we need a function that curves so that it will “hug” the graph of through a larger interval. Since quadratics are curved, experiment with your linear function from part (a) by adding on a term of the form . Record your choices for along with sketches of your new quadratic function and on the same axes. Give your final choice of quadratic function of the form that best imitates near .    You have now been able to extend the size of the interval where can be imitated by a polynomial by adding on a higher degree polynomial term. Can this continue? Take the quadratic function you have developed in part (c) and try to extend the interval of imitation further by adding on a third-degree term and experimenting with its coefficient. Give your final choice of cubic function of the form that best imitates near and sketch your graph of along with your cubic.    The polynomials you have created to imitate the function are called Taylor polynomials named for the mathematician, Brook Taylor. To understand why these particular coefficients work for imitating this function (as Jeff in vignette was asking), let's look at one other function ( ) and imitate it using a built-in command on your CAS. On most CAS, the command has similar syntax. On Maple, we use ; to get a seventh degree polynomial that mimics near zero. On a TI-Nspire CX CAS, the syntax is where the 0 at the end is the point near where you want to imitate the function and the is the variable you would like used in the polynomial (if you omit the value about which you want to imitate the function, it assumes a value of 0). On the TI-Nspire CX CAS you can find the command under the submenu of the menu.  Use your CAS's Taylor command to generate 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th degree Taylor polynomials for and record them in a table like the one in . Graph all of these along with on the same axes.    Odd Degree Polynomials for       Now in order to understand why these particular polynomials work, let's examine the 9th degree polynomial that you have found. As you learned in Calculus 1, we can infer information about the “shape” of a graph by looking at the derivative. More specific, the first derivative tells us the slope of the function at a given point, the second derivative tells us the rate at which the slope is changing, the third derivative tells us the rate at which the rate of the slope is changing and so on. With each higher order derivative, we gain more information about the “shape” of the graph and its behavior. This is the idea behind Taylor polynomials.  To explore this relationship, complete the following table where you evaluate the derivatives of both your polynomial and at . Record them in a table like the one in and state your observations related to your results.    Odd Degree Polynomials for       Now find the 8th degree Taylor polynomial for using your CAS's Taylor command. Repeat what you did in part (f). Record your results in a table like the one in and state your observations related to your results.    Odd Degree Polynomials for       Using your observations from parts (f) and (g), state a conjecture about the derivative of a Taylor polynomial and the derivative of the function it is imitating. Then test your conjecture with the 3rd degree Taylor polynomial for you found earlier.    In the special case of near zero, use your Taylor command to generate polynomials of degree 5, 6, 7, and 8 for . Describe the pattern you see for the general degree Taylor polynomial for .    Recall from Calculus 1, for . Explain how this fact is related to your results from the derivative of your general Taylor polynomial for .    The fact that we can create polynomials to imitate the functions , , and is extremely important from a practical sense. Have you ever wondered how your calculator knows the value of something like ? The operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are basic algorithms that exist as routines in any computer or calculator (note that exponents can be accomplished using repeated multiplication). If we wish to know , the machine can simply create a finite polynomial that imitates the sine function to the desired decimal accuracy and then compute it using these basic binary operations that make up the polynomial.  Now suppose you have only a non-scientific calculator (without sine, cosine, and tangent keys) and need to evaluate where the argument for sine is in radians. Explain how you could accomplish it? What about ? What about ?   "

In this lesson, the concepts surrounding complex numbers are expanded from their earlier introduction in Lesson 2 of Unit 6. In particular, the trigonometric form of complex numbers, , is discussed. In question 3 of the “Reflecting” section (p. 504), Euler's formula, , is stated and the students are expected to evaluate expressions using it; however, there is no treatment of the origin of Euler's formula. As a teacher, your job is to help students make connections between their earlier experiences in Unit 6 and their current experiences in Unit 7.  In addition, consider the following dialogue from Jan's earlier classroom situation where she is has taught (Lesson 2, Unit 6) is now teaching the content from Lesson 4 of Unit 7. She had assigned the questions from the “Reflecting” section of Lesson 4 (pp. 504-505) as homework. During the next class session, the following discussion occurred.   Jan : How did the homework go? Does anyone have questions?   Dan : When I got to question 3, I wasn’t sure where that to the theta thing came from?   Jan : Oh, that's just Euler's formula. The mathematician Euler came up with that a long time ago.   Dan : But I don't get where he got it.   Liz : I had the same sort of question. Isn't a real number?   Jan : Yes, it is.   Liz : Then how can you raise a real number to a power and get a number that's not real? That doesn't make sense. Didn't we say that if you multiply any two real numbers together, we get another real number? Like isn't real?   Jan : Yes, is real.   Liz : But if powers are just repeated multiplication, then why wouldn't to any power be real?   Dan : Yeah, I couldn't figure that out either.   Jan : But the power in is not real. So it can end up having an imaginary part.   Ken : But where did Euler get this thing? How did he figure out that ?   Jan : Well you'll just have to take my word for it right now. Euler used mathematics that you can't understand yet. You'll need to wait until you take more math before you can start to understand that.  With these situations in mind, in your groups, discuss and respond to the following questions.    Describe any connections you see between the content of Lesson 2 of Unit 6 and Lesson 4 of Unit 7.    Discuss your reaction to Jan's response to her students. In particular, how would you have handled the situation? Keep in mind that just as in , these students are in their fourth year of high school mathematics and have been exposed to the concept of derivative earlier in book 4A.   "

  "body": " A Complex Situation: Addressing Ken's Question   At the end of the classroom exchange from Jan's lesson, Ken asked the very understandable question, \"But where did Euler get this thing? How did he figure out that ?\". However, Jan's response of, \"Well you'll just have to take my word for it right now. Euler used mathematics that you can't understand yet.\" may not be entirely accurate. In this activity we explore how the use of Taylor polynomials can help Ken explore a surprising connection between trigonometry and the complex number systems. During the next activity, we will want to use the interactive sketch found in below.    Complex Plane with , , and       Recall from , we noticed that we can mimick the three transcendental functions, , , and by using the polynomials:     At this point, you may have noticed similarities among the three polynomial expansions that imitate the three transcendental functions: , , and . Describe any connections you see among the terms for these polynomial expansions.    Using the first six terms for each of the polynomial expansions of and , write out an expression for the approximation to .    Now using the substitution of in the polynomial expansion , write out the first twelve terms. On the TI-Nspire CAS you can do this by simply using the \"such that\" key entering after the expression for the Taylor polynomial you found for . Describe any patterns you see among the three polynomial expansions for , , and . Did this substitution help remedy any differences you noticed in part (a)? Explain.  Notice that the result you found in part (c) is a number that has both a real and an imaginary part. The terms that are similar to the polynomial for sine have the imaginary number attached by multiplication.  In this case we think of a complex number of the form as a point in the complex plane where the real part is plotted along the horizontal axis and the imaginary part is plotted along the vertical axis. As in the case of the relationship between rectangular and polar coordinates, we can also think of the same point defined by the rectangular form as also defined by an angle and a radius. For example, we can take the complex number and express it as the point in the complex plane located at a distance of 1 from the origin and at an angle of since . Although these are both helpful ways to represent complex numbers, is there another way that is even simpler?  Now considering the fact that we can express any complex number in the polar form, as you observed in part (c), what is the practical significance of your discovery? We will now investigate the relevance of this observation to basic operations on complex numbers.    As seen in , the complex numbers, , , and are sketched in the complex plane. Note that you can simply edit the real and imaginary components of and for each complex numbers on the left or drag them around. You are not able to drag since it is defined as the product of and and thus is dependent on them. The measure of the three angles are given on the left along with the magnitude for each of these complex numbers. Consider the two complex numbers, and as given in the figure. Explore the relationships among , , and by manipulating and . Describe any patterns that you notice.    Now express each of the numbers, , , and in polar form, . Do the results of the polar form agree with your observations from your sketch of the numbers plotted in the complex plane part (d)?    Noting the magnitude and angle of the three complex numbers, move by dragging it on the complex plane. What do you notice about the change in the angle and magnitude of as compared with the change you observed with ? Try the same process with and note the relationships between the angle and magnitude changes of . State your observations in the form of a conjecture.    Given your result from part (c), provide a simple explanation for the pattern you have just noticed in parts (d), (e), and (f) by expressing each complex number, , , and as a single exponential term of the form .

  "body": " Introduction to Sequences   In , we looked at the CCSS and noted that young learners tended be adept at analyzing patterns. Sequences are a type of pattern that can take on many representations and can allow for various approaches by students for analyzing and solving them. For this reason, this section will examine how students see sequences from both a mathematical and pedagogical perspective. While there are many different kinds of sequences, we will focus primarily on arithmetic, geometric, figurative, and recursive sequences. We will ground our discussion in some classroom excerpts where students are grappling with patterns and also address how the students begin to represent these patterns and the effect this has on their thinking. To begin, we should define what we mean by a sequence.    Sequence   A sequence is a list of terms , given in a specific order. These sequenced values can also be thought of as a function of the term number, , and denoted as . For the practical use of a computer algebra system, we often express the terms using function notation, , so that we can define it in the CAS and operate on its terms. To express the entire sequence we often use the notation, , since we can think of the entire sequence as a list such as .       Arithmetic Sequences  To begin, consider The Border Problem: Part 1 found in Connecting Mathematical Ideas: Middle School Video Cases to Support Teaching and Learning (2005) by Jo Boaler and Cathy Humphreys. In this video case, students are exploring the pattern for finding the number of small shaded squares along the outer edge of a larger square as seen in .    How Many Small Squares in the Shaded Region?       The Border Problem: Part 1 Reflection   Watch the classroom episode of Cathy Humphreys' 7th grade class working on ways to find the border of a square grid. This video is found in the book, Connecting Mathematical Ideas: Middle School Video Cases to Support Teaching and Learning (2005) by Jo Boaler and Cathy Humphreys. You may want to follow along with the provided transcript (pp. 1-5) from Boaler and Humphreys (2005) in case you have a hard time discerning what is being said.    As you watch the episode for the first time, make some notes of at least 3 things the teacher did to facilitate the discussion and some quick thoughts on why she chose this problem.    In looking at the CCSS for 7th grade, what are the relevant mathematical concepts involved in this classroom episode?    Compare your observations from the video with those of your fellow group members. Discuss in your groups why you think the teacher did what she did. How did the students respond?    The teacher, Cathy, in the episode allows for several different students to explain their way of determining the total number of squares and she writes their method on the board with numerical representations that align with the method. For example, Sharmeen shares her thinking, \"Well, first I started out with forty from ten times four and then I subtracted four from that because there would be four squares overlapping, and so that got thirty-six.\". Here Cathy writes on the board . At this point, Cathy asks the questions, \"And the four was for ...?\", and \"OK. And this four was for?\". Discuss in your groups why you think Cathy chose this move in the lesson? From an algebraic standpoint, what is she trying to set up for later discussion? How is Cathy's move related to Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno's model for the development of symbolic meaning (see and )?    Cathy then asks Colin to go up to the front and show his method. Colin shares, \"Anyway, so I, like, I know this side is ten so I just did like ten and then this one, this one's the overlapping one, so then this would be nine, then this one would be nine, too, because this one's overlapping. And then for this, one it'd be eight because these two, this one is being used by this one and this one is being used by that one.\" As Colin explains, Cathy writes on the board, . In looking at Sharmeen's and Colin's representations, how do you see them as the same? How are they different? Is there a way to move from one to the other in a way that makes physical sense?    Toward the end of the lesson, Cathy asks the students to imagine shrinking the square into a square. She then asks them to use whatever method they want from those previously discussed to determine the number of border square in the square. In your groups, discuss why you think Cathy asked this question and where you think she is going with this task?     Now that we have speculated about Cathy's plan for her class, let's see where she takes the discussion on the next day. In the next activity, pay attention to the way Cathy tries to draw connections between the physical representations of border squares and the way the computations are taking place.    The Border Problem: Part 2 Reflection   Watch the continuation of the classroom episode of Cathy Humphreys' 7th grade class working on ways to find the border of a square grid. This video is found in the book, Connecting Mathematical Ideas: Middle School Video Cases to Support Teaching and Learning (2005) by Jo Boaler and Cathy Humphreys. You may want to follow along with the provided transcript (pp. 1-5) from Boaler and Humphreys (2005) in case you have a hard time discerning what is being said.    In the episode, Cathy asks the question, \"What's staying the same in this arithmetic?\". Here Cathy is using the expression, . In your groups, discuss why you think Cathy is asking this question? What is she trying to accomplish with this question with respect to Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno's model?   In looking at Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno (see ), how do learners transition to new representation systems?     At this stage of the discussion, Sarah responds by saying, \"Well, the first two numbers are the same numbers and the last two numbers are the same numbers.\". Cathy then has the students work in their groups to try and find a way to represent the general process for computing the number of border squares. In her group, Sharmeen, shares, \"S and so . Though that's kind of complicated. Is there any other way to put it?\". Given Sharmeen's original method from the day before ( ), what question might you ask Sharmeen to help her link her current method to her previoous one?    As the discussion progresses, students share ways to represent the computation using more than one variable. Sharmeen abandons her original expression as a group member want to \"make it simpler\" and instead uses, . Recall that on the first day of The Border Problem, Cathy made an intentional effort to list all student approaches on the board with      In your groups, discuss how these multiple representations might play a role in transitioning the class to use only one variable. What will eventually happen with the expresions if all of the methods use the same variable to represent the \"10\" from their expressions of the square computation? How can Cathy leverage these expressions to help the students see they are the same?    At the beginning of the group work, Sharmeen expressed a way to express the total using only one variable (see part (b)), but then the group decided that it was \"kind of complicated\" and wanted to find another way to express it more simply. During the class discussion, Stephanie reiterates Sharmeen's expression by suggesting, \"Um, I think maybe you could, like, do plus for the top and the bottom, or whatever letter you're using, and then you could do . And that would give you the, um, the total border.\". If you were the teacher and had heard Sharmeen's group discussion while circulating in the class, what would you have done when Stephanie made her suggestion?    When looking at part (c), one of the representations given was . What question might you ask both Sharmeen and Stephanie to help link the prior representation to their symbolic expression? What does the \"8\" represent in Sharmeen's and Stephanie's expression?     The classroom exchange provides a context to explore this type of sequence. Understanding how a sequence behaves can give us, as teachers, a way to allow students to explore their own observations while facilitating a fruitful discussion. Cathy does a masterful job in allowing students to express their ideas and connecting them during the whole-class interaction. So, let's look a little deeper at this type of sequence by exploring the question Cathy posed when she asked the students to image shrinking the square to a and using various methods to compute the total number of small squares on the border. In this case, we will extend it more to consider the case.     Cathy asked her students to think about shrinking the square and to find a way to compute the number of small squares on the border. For this activity, we will collect data to analyze the characteristics of this type of sequence.    Using graph paper or small blocks, make a rough sketch or model of the first 8 cases (beginning with ). In a table, record a column for and another column for the number of blocks on the border.    Describe, in words, the behavior of the values in the column for the number of blocks on the border. How does the number change for successive values?    For the border, , express your sequence in the form where the first blank represents the first term in the sequence.    How does your description in parts (b) and (c) relate to the expressions the students were developing in Cathy's class?        A sequence, , is arithmetic if it can be expressed in the form , where is a constant called the common difference and is the initail term in the sequence.        For the following sequences, express them in the form, . Identify the initial term and the common difference in each.                           Geometric Sequences  Some sequences like arithmetic sequences have properites like a common difference between adjacent terms. There are many types of phenomena that can be explained by this behavior; however, there are other types of behavior that do no have a common difference (or constant rate of change). In the next activity, we will explore what can happen when the change between terms is not so easily described. To begin, consider the bouncing of a racquet ball as described in .     Ball Bounce Video      Ball Bounce and the Behavior of Its Sequence   Consider the bouncing ball shown in the video in . We are going to explore the behavior of the successive heights the ball reaches as it continues to bounce. You will notice that as it bounces the next height in the sequence is smaller than the previous height. Here we will see if we can describe this height change and use a sequence to predict the height of the ball on its bounce if we know the original height from which the ball was dropped.  To begin investigating infinite sequence, we start by grounding the mathematical concept within a real-world context. Let's consider the physical phenomenon arising from the bouncing ball we see in the video in . Suppose we drop a ball from a certain height and measure its position over time. One question we might want to explore deals with predicting the height of the ball during the bouncing process. In short, on the , , or bounce how high can we expect it to rise? What about the bounce? To begin, we must know something about the rebound height of the ball as it relates to the previous height before the drop. We will use a device called a Calculator-Based Ranger (CBR2™) to collect data related to this issue. This device will measure the distance of the ball from the sensor as a function of time. We want to find the height, so we will need to subtract the distance of the ball from the sensor from the height of the sensor. You may choose to collect your own data or use the data from the provided file, BallBounce.tns . As seen in the video, the data generated once the height is computed will look something like that data in .    Ball Bounce vs. Height       Ball Bounce Data    Bounce Number,  Height (meters)  Ratio    1      2      3      4      5          First we need to generate data for the height of the ball. Using the BallBounce.tns file, add a Lists & Spreadsheet page. Click the top of the first column next to the \"A\", and press the [var] key and select 3 Link To: and choose run1.time . Repeat this process at the top of the second column selecting run1.position as shown below.  To create a column with the actual height of the ball, we need to subtract the position data from the original height of the sensor from the floor. In the video, that height was measured to be 1.793 meters. If you are collecting your own data, use your measurement of the original height of the sensor. To do this, go to the top of the third column in your spreadsheet and click on top cell and type \"height\". Directly below that cell click on the cell and will appear. Now enter 1.793- and [var] and select run1.position as shown below. This will populate the column with the difference between the original sensor height and the position of the ball yielding the actual height of the ball.    Spreadsheet Ball Data      Use the trace feature to find successive peaks on the graph and record your data in a table like the one shown in . You do not need to worry about the time here since we are only interested in the sequences of heights as a function of bounce number.    Explore the relationship between a rebound height of the ball with respect to its previous height by computing the ratio, . Record your ratios in your table. Describe any pattern you see in the ratios you compute.    Use what you found in part (c) to predict the height of the ball on the rebound.     The relationship from term to term you have just explored is called geometric . Just like with arithmetic sequences where we can determine its arithmetic nature by subtracting adjacent terms to see if we always get the same result, with geometric sequences we can do the same, but using division instead of subtraction. In a sense, the structure of the behavior is the same, but instead of observing the relationship between addition and subtraction, we notice the analogous relationship between multiplication and division.    Geometric Sequence   A geometric sequence is a sequence of non-zero numbers where each term after the first term is found by multipying the previous term by a fixed number called the common ratio , . In otherwords, the sequence will be of the form, . If we were to list the terms, we would get . Therefore, the general term can be expressed as .     You will notice in the previous definition, if we take successive ratios as you did in the Ball Bounce activity, we get . We use the notation, , here since we are referring to the common ratio .     For the following sequences, determine if they are geometric, arithmetic, or neither. If a sequence is geometric, give the initial term and the common ratio. If it is arithmetic, give the initial term and the common difference.                           Recursive Sequences  In order to make connections with what is taught in the secondary curriculum, we begin by examining some activities from the Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP). This activity will set the stage for reflecting on both the mathematics and the teaching and learning practices involved in the exploration. In particular, we will consider the relevance of the depth of content knowledge on classroom decisions made by the teacher.    Over, and Over, and Over, and...(IMP)   To start, let's examine the supplemental problem titled, Over, and Over, and Over and… , from the fourth year text of IMP found on pages 153-154. Give responses to the following questions (a-d) before discussing them within your group. After you have provided individual responses to the questions, spend approximately 15 minutes discussing your answers within your group and record any changes or modifications to your original responses along with brief elaborations on why you may or may not have modified your responses.    What do you consider to be the relevant mathematical concepts involved in the exploration?    What do you think are the relevant standards from the CCSS in this activity?    Describe how you think content from undergraduate courses might be helpful in leading students through this investigation.    Imagine yourself in your first teaching position. You are handed the IMP text to use as your primary resource and find that the investigation, Over, and Over, and Over and… , is part of the material to be covered by the school. Describe how would you teach it and what you would expect from the students.     Now that you have started to reflect on the mathematics and pedagogy present in the exploration, consider the following classroom exchange as a teacher (Jill) interacts with her students. Following the vignette, you will be asked to respond to questions surrounding the discussion.    Case Study: Over and Over and Out   Jill's Algebra I class has been working with radicals and as a result of using her calculator, a student, Kay, raises a question during class.   Jill : How did the homework go last night? Does anyone have any questions about reducing the radical expressions?   Kay : Well, I don't really have a question about reducing the radicals, but I did have another question that's kind of related to what we're doing.   Jill : OK, go for it. What'ya got?   Kay : Well, as I was working on some of the radical simplifying stuff, I was checking them by using my calculator to see if my answer matched when I punched the original expression on the calculator. Anyway, I got to playing with my calculator during my advising period and noticed that when I entered something like and kept hitting the equals button, it ended up giving me 1. I tried it with and it did the same thing. Will that always happen?   Jill : Interesting. Maybe we should take some time to try this. (To the class) What I want you to do is get in your groups and see if you can find any numbers that when you take the square root over and over again do not end up at 1.  [ Jill allows the students to look for a counter example for about 10 minutes and then brings the class back together for discussion. ]   Jill : Well, what did you find?   Jeff : Our group couldn't find any number that didn't end up at 1.   Anna : Neither could ours.   Sean : At first our group thought we had found an example where it just kept getting bigger and bigger, but that was because I was using the x^2 button instead of the square root.   Jill : That raises an interesting question though, Sean. Does the type of operation make a difference in whether or not it converges to a certain number? The word converge just means that it gets closer and closer to that number as you keep repeating it. Yes, Erin. Do you want to say something?   Erin : Well, I have a graphing calculator and I was trying to find an easier way to enter this stuff in it to do the repeat. I used the ANS key. What it does is take the last thing you got out of your calculator and does a new thing to it. So what I did was put the square root of x in my Y= list and then entered on my screen and got 1.73 something. Then I just put in and kept hitting ENTER . This gave me the numbers that got closer and closer to 1.   Jill : That's a great idea. It also now makes it easier to try other types of functions like Sean's example. Let's go through what Erin was talking about together on our class set of graphing calculators. Take out your calculators and look up front.  [ Jill takes about 5 minutes to go through the mechanics of how to evaluate an iterated function on the graphing calculator and then sent the groups exploring different functions. She allowed them approximately 20 minutes to get started before the bell rang. She assigned them the task of exploring this for homework and told the class that they would continue with the discussion the next day. ]  The Next Day   Jill : Does anyone have anything to share from your exploring last night?   Jan : I thought I'd try some other types of roots and so I tried and it went to 1 too.   Jill : Did it go to 1 no matter what number you started with?   Jan : Yeah. For everything I tried. So I think that anything with roots will go to 1.   Sam : I thought that too, but I tried something a little different. I did the same thing Jan did with , but then I tried it by putting a 2 in front and used . This time it didn't go to 1, but went to 2.828 something. So, it looks like it can go to things other than 1. Can we make up a function that will go to any number we want?    Describe the central mathematical issues involved in the classroom exchange.    If you were in Jill's position, how would you facilitate the rest of the classroom discussion? Give a detailed account of what you would do next anticipating what the students might discover and how you would respond.     At this point we will take some time to explore some mathematical ideas related to the previous classroom vignette using an activity called, Evaluate Me Again Sam . In your groups, complete . The material needed for the activity is only a computer algebra system.    Evaluate Me Again, Sam   You may have at one time used a scientific or standard calculator and entered an evaluation for and then continued to press the √ or = key only to see the decimal approximation eventually get closer and closer to 1. This illustrates values of an infinite sequence where each element of the sequence is obtained by taking the previous element in the sequence and plugging it into a given function. In this investigation we will explore such sequences and look for common properties.   Problem Statement : In the example given above, a specific function, , and a specific starting point, , were used to generate the sequence. In this exploration, consider a more general question. Suppose you have a function and the infinite sequence, . In this exploration, we will examine this sequence for some specific families of functions and then generate more questions for further investigation.         Here we will use the TI-Nspire CX II CAS , but this can also be done with a variety of other computer algebra systems. To begin, we will explore a very familiar function, , for various values of the parameter, . Open a new document and select 1:New Document . When prompted, select 2:Add Graphs to open a graphing screen. Enter the function in the command line at the bottom of the screen and press [enter] to display the graph. You will be able to morph this graph later by grabbing it in order to explore the effect of the parameter, , on the sequence.    1st set of screenshots    In order to observe the behavior of this sequence graphically, generate a sequence plot by plotting the term number vs. the iterate values. To do this, insert a new page by pressing ctrl  +page and then selecting 2:Add Graphs . In this case, you do not want to graph a function, but the sequence points. To change the type of graph, press menu and then select 3:Graph Entry\/Edit followed by 7:Sequence and 1:Sequence . You will notice that the command line at the top of the screen will change yielding fields into which you can enter the sequence relationship and initial value (see images below). Since we want to generate an iterative sequence based on the function stored in , we enter so that the sequence plotter will use the function value of the pervious number in the sequence to generate the new number in the sequence. Use 0.5 as your initial value for now. You can adjust the viewing window by grabbing a tick mark on the axis by holding down the \"click\/grab\" key located in the center of the NavPad (mouse pad) until the hand closes. Dragging your finger across the NavPad will adjust the view. If you want to adjust only one axis scale at a time, simply hold down the shift key while you move on the screen. To adjust where the axes are located within the window, move to any open space in the graphing window and hold the \"click\/grab\" key down until the hand closes, then move the entire graph to any location you desire (see images below).    2nd set of screenshots      3rd set of screenshots    In order to explore the relationship between the parameter, , and the behavior of the sequence, it will be helpful to view the function and the sequence plot side-by-side. In order to do this press +page to insert a new page and then press esc since you do not wish to insert just one application, but two in a side-by-side layout. Now press doc and select 5:Page Layout and 2:Select Layout followed by 2:Layout 2 . This will give a side-by-side partitioned screen that will allow you to place a different application in each partition.    4th set of screenshots      5th set of screenshots    In order to copy the graph page for both the function and the scatter plot, you must first select them. Page back to the function graph by pressing ctrl followed by the left arrow until you get to the page you want. Unfortunately you cannot just copy the page, but must “select” it first. To do this, press doc and then select 5:Page Layout followed by 3:Select App . In the future, the shortcut for selecting an application is ctrl  K . You will see the border of the screen begin to flash indicating it is selected. Then press ctrl  C to copy it (just like on a computer). Now page back to the split screen by pressing ctrl followed by the right arrow until you reach it. To paste the graphing screen into the left side, just press ctrl  V (like paste on a computer). To get the sequence plot pasted into the right side of the screen, repeat this process, but you will need to click on the right side of the screen to make it active before pasting. You will know that a portion of the screen is active since it will have a darkened border around it (see screens below).    6th set of screenshots    At this point you are ready to examine the effects of the parameter, , on the behavior of the sequence. The side-by-side view of the two graphs allows you to manipulate the function and see the sequence plot change dynamically in real time. To do this, move the cursor to the edge of the parabola until you see the dilation icon appear as shown below. Press and hold the click key until the \"hand\" closes to grab the parabola then use the arrow keys to “morph” it. To \"let go\" just press esc .    Sketch the graphs for at least four different values of in . Describe any patterns you may see. Will the sequence always converge?  As you have seen, the parameter, , affects the behavior of the sequence. Are there other factors that also affect the behavior of the sequence? You may have already considered the possibility that the “seed”, or initial, value might also affect it. At this point change the seed value and investigate how the parameter, , and the seed value interact. You can change the seed by clicking in the sequence window and editing the initial term or by grabbing the initial point (green) in the sequence plot and moving it or editing it directly in the command line. To make the command line visible, press ctrl  G or double click in any white space in the window.    7th set of screenshots      Record your data for at least two other seed values and the corresponding different values of for each seed sketching your plots. Does there appear to be a relationship between the seed and a? Describe any patterns you may see.  Since we will want to explore the effects of the seed value for multiple trials, it will make it easier to place an editable seed value on the graphing page. To do this, on the graphing page containing the parabola, select menu and then 1:Actions followed by B:Insert Slider . Type the variable name, , into the slider Variable dialogue box and press enter . You can place the slider anywhere in the window and elongate it by grabbing the dot on either end. To adjust the slider after it is set in place, click on the slider box and press ctrl  menu to open the attributes and select 1:Move to move location or 2:Settings and edit the settings as you wish. You can also change the slider settings to allow finer step sizes when dragging (below shows changing it to 0.01).    8th set of screenshots    Now to connect the slider to the sequence plot, edit the sequence plot setting as you did before so that the Initial Term simply reads, seed . This will now allow you to change the seed value on the graphing page for the function. You can also move the slider to a convenient place on the screen so that it is not interfering with the view of the graph.    9th set of screenshots      Investigate other combinations of and the . Record your data and sketches. Does there appear to be a relationship between the seed and ? Describe any patterns you may see. Based on your observations, can you predict whether or not the sequence will converge?    Repeat your process from part (c) for another seed value recording your data and sketches. Did your second choice of seed value confirm or refute any earlier conjectures? Explain.  Although we may have a conjecture at this point, we still need to prove that this conjecture will always hold. To accomplish this, we turn to the algebraic representation. Open a new Calculator page by pressing ctrl  +page and selecting 1:Add Calculator . Define the function by pressing menu and selecting 1:Actions followed by 1:Define . Then enter the function, keeping in mind that implied multiplication is not recognized between two letters and that you must use the [ ] key. We can explore a few cases for on the Calculator page (see below).    10th set of screenshots    Since the spreadsheet in the CAS allows symbolic entries, we can use the Generate Sequence feature to look at repeated iterations of the function composition. To do this, insert a new 4:Lists & Spreadsheet page. Give the first column a title of, . Now generate the sequence of compositions as shown below by entering in the first open cell. In cell A2, enter just as you would in Excel. You will see an algebraic result appear. Now move your cursor to the bottom right corner of the cell until you see a appear and click and drag down the column to perform a “fill down”. You should see expressions appear (see below).    11th set of screenshots      Examining several different iterations of composed with itself, describe any patterns you see. How might we prove any patterns that you may observe will always hold?    Enter several different iterations of composed with itself where instead of the initial input being , the input is . What output do you get for each case you try? How do the input and output compare?     Before we continue our discussion of the mathematics involved here, reread the vignette of the classroom discussion in the Case Study: Over and Over and Out found in .    Over, and Over, and Over, and Out: Revisited     Now that we have spent some time exploring the mathematics involved in the situation that played out in the vignette where Sam made an interesting observation, let's look at how we might change our approach to leading the class discussion.    In light of your conclusions from , devise a strategy to investigate Sam's question at the end of the vignette. You may want to graph the line along with your function, . Describe anything you notice about these two graphs.    Try graphing Sam's function along with . What do you notice?    How is the line related to your observations from ?    Suppose you wish to solve a polynomial of the form . Consider the transformed equation . Now let . Discuss a practical application of the iteration convergence process you have just explored as it is applied to and its relationship to the solution of the original equation, . How does Sam's question at the end of the vignette relate to the ability to find real solutions to ?  Now let's revisit your original responses to the vignette in . In the next few questions, try to view the vignette through the lens of undergraduate mathematics. In particular, try to relate your experiences from our mathematical exploration in to what is happening in the classroom exchange in Jill's class.    In light of your experience in , describe the central mathematical issues involved in the classroom exchange.    Describe how your facilitation of the rest of the classroom discussion would change from how you responded earlier in based on your experiences in . Give specific examples to illustrate what you would do.     One of the difficulties common to pre-service teacher preparation is the ability to see how the undergraduate mathematics curriculum is connected to the secondary curriculum. To address this, we will again examine a secondary mathematics curriculum, The Interactive Mathematics Program and reflect on how this type of curriculum is related to the classroom discussion from our previous vignette and to the undergraduate mathematics explored in Evaluate Me Again, Sam ( ).     Again, read through the supplemental problem titled, Over, and Over, and Over and… , from The Interactive Mathematics Program from the fourth year text of IMP found on pages 153-154.    Compare\/contrast the text's approach to the investigation and the teacher's approach from the vignette.    Working in your groups from the activity Evaluate Me Again Sam , discuss how the IMP approach addresses or fails to address student comments and questions from the vignette.    Based on your experiences with Evaluate Me Again Sam , describe how the mathematics content learned in the undergraduate curriculum would affect your classroom decisions if you were to find yourself in the same situation as Jill in the vignette.     The previous explorations have given us some insight into predicting when an iterative sequence will converge and when it might diverge. So how can we be certain of the behavior and then, as teachers, help our students discover the properties behind the behavior? Here we will take a deeper look into the observations made in our previous investigations and see how iterative sequences can play a role in practical applications.  The concept of iteration is an important part of the mathematical landscape. It is used in real-world applications to find solutions that have no direct algebraic solution as well as for approximating values of mathematical constants such as and . Having taken Calculus, you are already familiar with one such iteration process, Newton's Method. Recall that Newton's Method allows the approximation of roots by using the projection along a tangent line to the x-axis as a new approximation of the root. Then the new value from the x-axis is used as the new point of tangency and the process continues until the desired level of accuracy for the root is achieved.        We know that some equations of the form can be solved exactly (e.g. using the quadratic formula). However, the general equations that can be solved exactly are very few within the realm of mathematical endeavor. To be able to approximate a solution, Isaac Newton noticed that as a point on a curve approaches the root of the function, its tangent line at that point begins to have an x-intercept that is approximately the root desired (see ).    Tangents Lines and Newton's Method     Newton's idea was to “surf” the tangent line. In other words, pick an x-coordinate of a point you know is close to the actual root, and then find where the tangent line to the curve at that point intersects the x-axis. Now use the x-intercept of the tangent line as the new x-coordinate as stated earlier and repeat the process. With each iteration, the approximation gets closer to the root of the function.  For example, suppose you wish to find the solution for , where . As you can see, one solution is approximately 2 as can be seen from the graph in .    Graph of     In order to find a better approximation, we can notice that if is our initial guess, then the next choice for an approximation of the root will be , since this is where the tangent line at intersects the x-axis. Repeating this process will give better approximations.  In practice, we can approximate using Newton's Method on our CAS by entering the original function in one location and the formula for the next approximation in another function location referring to the original function. In the figure below, the original function is entered in the function and the iteration formula is in for “Newton's Method” (see ).  We now simply evaluate the function at our initial guess and then successively using our result as the new input into . You can see that with just a few iterations, we get a solution to 11-decimal place accuracy. Here we have actually approximated since the function we are using is .    Numerical Iterations of Newton's Method     From a graphical standpoint, suppose we begin with an initial value of 3. The x-intercept of the tangent line at is 2 and thus a new tangent is constructed at . As can be seen from the sketch in , the new x-intercept is much closer to the root. It does not take many iterations of this process to get extremely accurate approximations.    Tangent Lines in Newton's Method Approaching          As we have seen from exploration and classroom vignettes, not all self-iterating functions yield a convergence. So how can we tell if a particular function will converge to a value at all or whether or not it may have multiple values that are possible for convergence? How do we predict the value to which they will converge? Are there any criteria that can be applied to predict convergence?  Let us begin by examining the familiar function from the activity, Evaluate Me Again Sam , , with . Below is a graph of along with the graph of . The reason for will become evident shortly. Assume that is continuous and differentiable on the desired interval. Also let us define the iteration by stating . All this says is that we choose the previous output of as the new input of each time we iterate the function with itself. Here is the reason for graphing along with . Since the outputs are found along the y -axis, we get . This process is shown by the arrows marking the progress of the iteration on the graph in . We begin with and find its corresponding output ( ) on the function. We then move horizontally until we meet the line since this is where x and y are the same. We now move vertically to the x -axis so that we stop on the “new input” ( ). We repeat the process by moving vertically to the function's new output. As you can see by following the arrows in the graph, we keep moving closer and closer to the point of intersection between the graph of and . But why is the intersection with important?    Iteration Sequence Attracting to Fixed Point of     The point where a function intersects the line is important and is called a fixed point . The reason it plays a vital role in the convergence of iterated functions is that it has the property of the function's output being equal to the function's input.     A fixed point of a function, , is a number, , in the domain of such that . In other words, when applying , the point, , stays fixed.     Since the convergence of an iterated function relies on the fact that the when and thus assuming continuous, the intersection of and gives us possible values of convergence for our iterated function. We can gain insight into some general principles for convergence by looking at the earlier investigation found in the IMP materials, Over, and Over, and Over, and… . Recall that in this exploration, the students began with linear functions. For functions such as , the iterated function diverged no matter what initial seed value was chosen. Consider the function and examine the progression of the inputs as shown in using arrows along the graph. Notice that no matter which side of the fixed point you begin with, the result converges on the fixed point.    Iteration Sequence Attracting to Fixed Point of     Now consider the function, .     Iteration Sequence Repelling from Fixed Point of from Left   Iteration Sequence Repelling from Fixed Point of     Iteration Sequence Repelling from Fixed Point of from Right   Iteration Sequence Repelling from Fixed Point of      As can be seen here, no matter which side of the fixed point we choose, the iteration diverges to either . In this case, the fact that is steeper than means as we choose points near the fixed point to use for iteration, the mapping onto the line prior to the re-evaluation of moves away from the fixed point. As we saw with the function earlier, the mapping back to the line prior to re-evaluation of causes the to approach the fixed point. The behavior near these types of fixed points has given rise to the categorizations of repelling and attracting fixed points.  So if sometimes we are repelled from a fixed point and sometimes we are attracted to one, how can we tell what will happen? For example, when using , we saw any seed we used be attracted to 1, but with , it was repelled. Why?  To look deeper into this let's reconsider our earlier activity from IMP, Over, and Over, and Over, and... , we discussed in .    Over, and Over, and Over, and...: Analyzed   In looking at the IMP activity, Over, and Over, and Over, and... , we noticed that in some cases iteration converged, but in other cases we had divergence. Instead of looking at specific linear functions, here we will take a look at the general case for .    On your CAS, define the function, . Note that on most CAS, you need to make sure to use the multiplication operator between the and the since we could easily name a variable with a multi-letter name. Now use your CAS to evalute and obtain expressions for , , , and . Describe any patterns you see in the expressions.   When grouping terms, give your responses as a single term with an and another term with a factored out of a sum of terms involving .    If represents the iteration of the function with itself, give an expression for .    Based on your observations, we want to prove that your conjecture for is always true. Proof by induction is a means to do this. Essentially, you assume it is true for the iteration and then try to show it is true for the case. Based on your expression from part (b), assume the form of and plug in for in your expression and rearrange the terms. Do you get the same thing as if you replaced all of the in your expression with ? If so, you have shown that you can always get to the next largest value and so this will continue to infinity.    Now that we have established that your expression for will always work, we need to find when this will converge and when it will diverge. Consider the long sum that is associated with in your expression (a sum of powers of ). Based on what you know from geometric series (think back to Calculus 2), for what values of will this series converge?    If the sum in the term associated with in your expression converges for your conditions on , will those same values of also guarantee that the term involing the will also converge? Explain.     As you have observed in your investigation in , for a linear function, the iteration's convergence depends on the value of the slope, . This leads to the following theorem where the proof consists of your observations from the activity.     Let be a linear function and let . The sequence, , converges if and diverges if .    Consider the iterations for and . In general, we could conclude that . We can use proof by induction to show this holds. Assume . We get . Expanding and collecting like terms gives , and therefore . By induction, this holds. In order to converge, the geometric series needs . If , then as and thus converges. If then the series diverges and the term will either diverge or simply be in the case of . In either case, will diverge.     The use of linear functions to analyze the convergence or divergence of the iterated function is helpful since as with any continuous and differentiable function, we consider them locally linear as we zoom in on a fixed point. If we have a curved function with a fixed point and we start to get close to the fixed point, it will start to behave like the line in . Therefore, this leads us to the following argument regarding convergence of iterated functions with fixed points.     Let be a continuous and differentiable function with a fixed point, . Further, let . If lies on an interval, , containing such that for all , then converges to .    Suppose such that for all . Since and  . Now by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists some between and such that and thus . Since and by assumption for all   for some with . Therefore, . Using a similar argument, . In general, we can state that . Since , we get and thus .     So what does this theorem say about convergence to fixed points? Basically, the theorem says that if the fixed point, , is in an interval where , then the mapping that transforms the outputs to inputs back into the function is expanding and thus the iteration process diverges.          Although Newton's Method is very efficient for finding zeros of a function, a more simplistic method involves only the iteration of a function with itself using only a small alteration. Suppose you are looking for the root of a polynomial, . The process boils down to solving the equation, . Now consider the transformed equation formed by adding to both sides of the original equation, . If we let , we are essentially finding a solution to . We know from our earlier discussion that this solution is simply a fixed point for . Based on the fact that repeated iteration will converge to a fixed point (if convergence does occur), we can simply take the original function, add , and then iterate it with itself as a method to find its root. The down side of this process is that not all fixed points are accessible through iteration as we have seen in earlier examples. However, this does remain a very simple algorithm for finding roots although not as efficient as Newton's Method.    Figurative Sequences   The last type of sequence we will explore is a figurative sequence . Consider the following classroom exchange between a teacher, Sarah, and her algebra class. In this class, Sarah is having her students explore patterns based on the construction of staircases using blocks.     Step It Up   Sarah has been working with her students on sequences and has posed the following task where they need to build staircases using blocks of the form found in .    Block Staircases      Sarah : I gave each group some blocks and I want you to build at least the first four sets of staircases as I have drawn on the board. Notice that the staircases I have drawn have heights of one, two, and three. Our main goal is to be able to determine how many blocks we would need to build a staircase with a height of 50. We could simply start building it, but we would not be sure how many blocks we would need before we began. So, collect some data and see if you can find a pattern that would allow us to compute it.  [ Sarah allows the students to spend about 20 minutes building some models and recording some data. ]   Sarah : OK, let's see what you've come up with. [ Sarah draws a group number out of her bucket to determine which gorup will report out ]. Group 4. What did you find?   Cait : Well, we just noticed that when we built them, we could just take the staircase that we built before and put a row on the bottom that was just one block more than the bottom of the staircase.   Sarah : Nice observation. Did any other groups notice any other patterns? Yeah, Ben?   Ben : We just built a bunch and wrote the total blocks in a table. At first we thought it might be an arithmetic sequence and it kind of was, but not.   Sarah : What do you mean, \"...it kind of was, but not.\"?   Ben : Well, when we subtracted we didn't get a common difference, but did get a pattern.   Sarah : Can you describe your pattern?   Ben : Instead of the numbers always being the same, they just kept getting bigger. You know... one at a time. Like at first the difference was 2, then 3, then 4, and so on. So it was kind of arithmetic, but it was the differences that was arithmetic because those all had a change of 1. You know, from 2 to 3 is 1, then from 3 to 4 is 1, and from 4 to 5 is also 1.   Sarah : That's kind of interesting. Is this connected to Cait's group in any way? Yeah, Liam?   Liam [ from Cait's group ]: Ben's numbers are just what we were sayin'. His numbers in his differences were just going up by one like us when we were sayin' we added a row on the botton that was one more than the one that came before.    In your groups, discuss what you would do to lead the next stage of the discussion. Keep in mind that Sarah ultimately wants to have the students move beyond a recursive method of computing the total number of block toward a \"closed form\" expression where they could just plug the height of the staircase into the expression and get the total number of blocks out.    Now that you have discussed what you might do from a pedagogical perspective, try to find a \"closed form\" expression. Ultimately, you will need to try and prove your expression will always work. Be prepared to share your strategies with the rest of the class.   Consider two different approaches. For the first, create a scatterplot of the data and perform a regression. For the second approach, construct two staircases of the same height and consider how they might fit together like a puzzle.    Based on the two different approaches from part (b), how might the method you use influence the way you might try to prove the pattern will always work?   Consider viewing things as triangles or rectangles.        A figurative sequence is a sequence of numbers based on geometric shapes or visual patterns. In the example from Sarah's class, you could see the staircases as triangles and thus we would call this sequence a triangular sequence (or triangular numbers).       Understanding Sequences and the Role of Representations   As we seek to develop students' conceptual understanding of various topics, we need to consider the role representations play in such development. Here we will examine some of the literature regarding various representational uses as it relates specifically to the teaching and learning of sequences and series. Although from a formal perspective, algebraic representations might be considered the most powerful as we can use them to present analytic proof, we often overlook the power inherent in other representations, particularly with respect to concept development. Once we have developed a concept, reasoning from the algebraic representation might seem second nature to us. However, once we have been temporally removed from the development of the concept in our own experience, we often lose perspective on how the newcomer to the concept constructs understanding. This point of view is supported by Weigand's (1991) findings where the teachers in the study only compared the different representations to existing concepts in their view—a much different approach than the students in the study who used the various representations to develop the concept. In the words of Janvier (1987), “As soon as formulae are provided, the meaning appears to vanish. We can easily imagine that such is the case with conceptions fading out because of 'powerful' concepts. That is why we advocate that conceptions should be developed at the preconcept stage, in other words prior to the learning of the formalized concept” (p. 157).   Since we are using the Over and Over and Over and… activity from the Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP) it is fitting to examine the previously mentioned study by Weigand (1991) where he examined 11th graders' learning of the same iterated sequence found in the IMP text. In Weigand's study, 79 students and 22 secondary mathematics teachers were engaged in exploring sequences generated by iterating functions. One of the goals was to investigate the influence representations have on students' abilities to discover properties and solve problems. Weigand chose iterated sequences as a context for the study because it is often difficult to express sequences in explicit algebraic terms. Therefore, the use of a variety of representations becomes necessary in order for students to explore the behavior of these sequences. Weigand examined six different non-algebraic representations: Beginning of Sequence, Table, Cobweb Diagram, Graph, Arrow Chain, and Arrow Diagram. These representations can be seen in , , , and .    Beginning of Sequence (Weigand, 1991, p. 412)   Beginning of Sequence       Table & Cobweb Diagram (Weigand, 1991, pp. 412-413)   Table and Cobweb Diagram       Graph & Arrow Chain (Weigand, 1991, p. 414)   Graph and Arrow Chain       Arrow Diagram (Weigand, 1991, p. 415)   Arrow Diagram     In these representations, the numerical view of sequence was embodied primarily in the Beginning of Sequence and Table format while the geometric view was primarily embodied within the Cobweb Diagram , Graph , and Arrow Chain diagrams. What is interesting is that from a geometric perspective, the cobweb and arrow representations were not effective in relating the representation to the sequence. These were viewed primarily as pictorial descriptions rather than relationships. For someone already familiar with the concept of iterative sequences, the cobweb diagram makes sense and can lend additional meaning to the user, but to the newcomer, it adds little and in fact, can lead to incorrect mathematical interpretations (Weigand, 1991). Although Weigand's results cannot definitively explain why the geometric representations apart from the graphs were not effective in connecting the representation to the relations involved in the sequence, one might speculate that it may be related to the lack of exposure to such representations. Weigand suggests that in order for students to deepen their understanding of a concept such as iterative sequences, “[they] must also be given the opportunity to use this variety of representations. When teaching using these elements, the computer can be an indispensable aid and tool” (p. 433).  In order to help students develop reasoning skills related to a concept, it is also important that the teacher is aware of how students make use of representations. As Weigand found, the teachers and students applied different methods of thinking. The teachers tended to use more formal mathematical thinking strategies while the students made use of informal approaches involving different representations. It is crucial that teachers not ignore the ways in which students think as they plan instruction. Weigand suggests that his results support the demand typically given to symbolic representations in contrast to iconic ones within the classroom since, to the teacher, the goal is to move in the direction of symbolic forms.  So what are the advantages and disadvantages of different representations? While the numerical representations found in Weigand's beginning of sequence and table formats offer views of the actual value to which a sequence is converging, these representations do little to offer insight into an overall behavior of a sequence. Weigand found that unsuccessful students tended to use the numerical forms; beginning of sequence and table representations, and did not use any graphical representations at all. He found that for most solutions strategies, students needed to deal with comparisons of sequences with different initial values. The numerical representations force students to do a comparison of terms on a one-by-one basis. In contrast, the graphical representations provide comparison of many terms in a single view allowing broader patterns to be detected.  Even though the graphical representation allows the students to see the sequence behavior from a broader perspective, Weigand also reports that students still had difficulty connecting the properties of the function used to generate the iterative sequence and the iterative sequence itself. In this case, students did see the iterative sequence as a functional relationship, but described the properties of the sequence dynamically with no connection to the recursive nature of the sequence's origin or the properties of the generating function. The result of this disconnected view of sequence iteration is that students “hardly used arguments which could be applied to all iteration sequences” (Weigand, 1991, p. 434).  So how do we help students view commonalities that might apply to iteration sequences in general? One of the challenges is to help students make broader observations with respect to sequence behavior. Just as the graphical representation gave a broader perspective of the sequence behavior in comparison to the numerical representation in Weigand's study, we need to find a way to allow a “bigger view” of multiple graphical representations as parameters in the situation change in order to give a broader perspective of change across situations. Lapp and St. John (2009) describe just such an environment where students notice patterns across multiple graphical representations as parameters in the situation change. The key to describing the change of changing graphs lies in dynamically linked representations where the change in one triggers real-time change in the others. In this case, students have the graph and algebraic representation of the generating function appearing on one side of a viewing window and the graph of the scatter plot of the iterative sequence on the other side of the same viewing window (see ). Here the graph of the generating function can be grabbed and pulled resulting in changes in both the graphical and algebraic representations of the function. As the graph is manipulated, the scatter plot of the iterative sequence dynamically changes in the same field of view. This use of technology allows students to not only see the sequence behavior, but also the corresponding behavior of the function that creates the sequence, thus addressing a problem found with students in Weigand's study.    Dynamically Changing and the Sequence (Lapp & St. John, 2009)   Dynamically Changing and the Sequence     While the graphical representations can help students notice patterns, in mathematics, we do rely on algebraic reasoning for proving properties in a general sense. A concern for the lack of connection to algebraic representations is voiced by Alcock and Simpson (2004). In this study, some students who used graphical representations maintained a strong sense that they understood the concepts. The problem was that some of these students did not feel a need to examine the more formal representations used for proof. Alcock and Simpson did find that some students who relied on visual or graphical representations made connections to algebraic properties, but these students tended to be students whose “beliefs about learning mathematics prompt them to seek overall integration of both visual and algebraic\/verbal representations of the material” (p. 29). The students who seem to be motivated to seek such integration tended to have a stronger sense of internal authority with respect to mathematics. The students who did not seek integration tended to have an external sense of authority where mathematics is viewed as a set of conventions and procedures to be learned.  The lesson to be learned from this is that we need to help students develop a sense of internal authority so that they will more naturally seek integration of informal and formal representations. Accomplishing this task of motivating a sense of internal authority can be a challenge. One suggestion is to transition from guided discovery to inquiry teaching by asking appropriate questions until students begin to ask those questions themselves. Connecting algebraic reasoning to graphical behavior is also described by Lapp and St. John (2009). Here students are asked specifically to explain the graphical behavior they have observed in terms of algebraic representations. The students in this case used the computer algebra system to extend the patterns to algebraic representations and then reason from those representations (see ). Alcock and Simpson (2004) suggest this same approach when they state, “in order to help other visualizing students build on their existing strengths, we need to think about ways to have them engage in work that will help them to build such links” (p. 30).    Algebraic Reasoning to Justify the Observed Patterns (Lapp & St. John, 2009)   Algebraic Reasoning to Justify the Observed Patterns     In summary, we suggest a need to use dynamically connected representations in conjunction with a move toward inquiry approaches to teaching. The literature suggests a need to engage students in “doing” mathematics while using many representations. Our perspective is that when students can view the technology as a tool for investigation, autonomy in the problem-solving process will be more likely. If the students can easily move between representations and the teacher models such movement, we can empower the students to become self-learners relying on an internal sense of authority.     Consider the following pattern of toothpicks.    Toothpick Sequence     Sketch the first five figures in the sequence.    Give a list of the number of toothpicks in the figure for .

Use proof by induction to show that your observations from part (c) are always true.

You may want to follow along with the provided transcript (pp. 1-5) from Boaler and Humphreys (2005) in case you have a hard time discerning what is being said.    As you watch the episode for the first time, make some notes of at least 3 things the teacher did to facilitate the discussion and some quick thoughts on why she chose this problem.    In looking at the CCSS for 7th grade, what are the relevant mathematical concepts involved in this classroom episode?    Compare your observations from the video with those of your fellow group members. Discuss in your groups why you think the teacher did what she did. How did the students respond?    The teacher, Cathy, in the episode allows for several different students to explain their way of determining the total number of squares and she writes their method on the board with numerical representations that align with the method. For example, Sharmeen shares her thinking, \"Well, first I started out with forty from ten times four and then I subtracted four from that because there would be four squares overlapping, and so that got thirty-six.\". Here Cathy writes on the board . At this point, Cathy asks the questions, \"And the four was for ...?\", and \"OK. And this four was for?\". Discuss in your groups why you think Cathy chose this move in the lesson? From an algebraic standpoint, what is she trying to set up for later discussion? How is Cathy's move related to Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno's model for the development of symbolic meaning (see and )?    Cathy then asks Colin to go up to the front and show his method. Colin shares, \"Anyway, so I, like, I know this side is ten so I just did like ten and then this one, this one's the overlapping one, so then this would be nine, then this one would be nine, too, because this one's overlapping. And then for this, one it'd be eight because these two, this one is being used by this one and this one is being used by that one.\" As Colin explains, Cathy writes on the board, . In looking at Sharmeen's and Colin's representations, how do you see them as the same? How are they different? Is there a way to move from one to the other in a way that makes physical sense?    Toward the end of the lesson, Cathy asks the students to imagine shrinking the square into a square. She then asks them to use whatever method they want from those previously discussed to determine the number of border square in the square.

Given Sharmeen's original method from the day before ( ), what question might you ask Sharmeen to help her link her current method to her previoous one?

  "body": " Ball Bounce and the Behavior of Its Sequence   Consider the bouncing ball shown in the video in . We are going to explore the behavior of the successive heights the ball reaches as it continues to bounce. You will notice that as it bounces the next height in the sequence is smaller than the previous height. Here we will see if we can describe this height change and use a sequence to predict the height of the ball on its bounce if we know the original height from which the ball was dropped.  To begin investigating infinite sequence, we start by grounding the mathematical concept within a real-world context. Let's consider the physical phenomenon arising from the bouncing ball we see in the video in . Suppose we drop a ball from a certain height and measure its position over time. One question we might want to explore deals with predicting the height of the ball during the bouncing process. In short, on the , , or bounce how high can we expect it to rise? What about the bounce? To begin, we must know something about the rebound height of the ball as it relates to the previous height before the drop. We will use a device called a Calculator-Based Ranger (CBR2™) to collect data related to this issue. This device will measure the distance of the ball from the sensor as a function of time. We want to find the height, so we will need to subtract the distance of the ball from the sensor from the height of the sensor. You may choose to collect your own data or use the data from the provided file, BallBounce.tns . As seen in the video, the data generated once the height is computed will look something like that data in .    Ball Bounce vs. Height       Ball Bounce Data    Bounce Number,  Height (meters)  Ratio    1      2      3      4      5          First we need to generate data for the height of the ball. Using the BallBounce.tns file, add a Lists & Spreadsheet page. Click the top of the first column next to the \"A\", and press the [var] key and select 3 Link To: and choose run1.time . Repeat this process at the top of the second column selecting run1.position as shown below.  To create a column with the actual height of the ball, we need to subtract the position data from the original height of the sensor from the floor. In the video, that height was measured to be 1.793 meters. If you are collecting your own data, use your measurement of the original height of the sensor. To do this, go to the top of the third column in your spreadsheet and click on top cell and type \"height\". Directly below that cell click on the cell and will appear. Now enter 1.793- and [var] and select run1.position as shown below. This will populate the column with the difference between the original sensor height and the position of the ball yielding the actual height of the ball.    Spreadsheet Ball Data      Use the trace feature to find successive peaks on the graph and record your data in a table like the one shown in . You do not need to worry about the time here since we are only interested in the sequences of heights as a function of bounce number.    Explore the relationship between a rebound height of the ball with respect to its previous height by computing the ratio, . Record your ratios in your table. Describe any pattern you see in the ratios you compute.    Use what you found in part (c) to predict the height of the ball on the rebound.   "

Jill : How did the homework go last night? Does anyone have any questions about reducing the radical expressions?   Kay : Well, I don't really have a question about reducing the radicals, but I did have another question that's kind of related to what we're doing.   Jill : OK, go for it. What'ya got?   Kay : Well, as I was working on some of the radical simplifying stuff, I was checking them by using my calculator to see if my answer matched when I punched the original expression on the calculator. Anyway, I got to playing with my calculator during my advising period and noticed that when I entered something like and kept hitting the equals button, it ended up giving me 1. I tried it with and it did the same thing. Will that always happen?   Jill : Interesting. Maybe we should take some time to try this. (To the class) What I want you to do is get in your groups and see if you can find any numbers that when you take the square root over and over again do not end up at 1.  [ Jill allows the students to look for a counter example for about 10 minutes and then brings the class back together for discussion. ]   Jill : Well, what did you find?   Jeff : Our group couldn't find any number that didn't end up at 1.   Anna : Neither could ours.   Sean : At first our group thought we had found an example where it just kept getting bigger and bigger, but that was because I was using the x^2 button instead of the square root.   Jill : That raises an interesting question though, Sean. Does the type of operation make a difference in whether or not it converges to a certain number? The word converge just means that it gets closer and closer to that number as you keep repeating it. Yes, Erin. Do you want to say something?   Erin : Well, I have a graphing calculator and I was trying to find an easier way to enter this stuff in it to do the repeat. I used the ANS key. What it does is take the last thing you got out of your calculator and does a new thing to it. So what I did was put the square root of x in my Y= list and then entered on my screen and got 1.73 something. Then I just put in and kept hitting ENTER . This gave me the numbers that got closer and closer to 1.   Jill : That's a great idea. It also now makes it easier to try other types of functions like Sean's example. Let's go through what Erin was talking about together on our class set of graphing calculators. Take out your calculators and look up front.  [ Jill takes about 5 minutes to go through the mechanics of how to evaluate an iterated function on the graphing calculator and then sent the groups exploring different functions. She allowed them approximately 20 minutes to get started before the bell rang. She assigned them the task of exploring this for homework and told the class that they would continue with the discussion the next day. ]  The Next Day   Jill : Does anyone have anything to share from your exploring last night?   Jan : I thought I'd try some other types of roots and so I tried and it went to 1 too.   Jill : Did it go to 1 no matter what number you started with?   Jan : Yeah. For everything I tried. So I think that anything with roots will go to 1.   Sam : I thought that too, but I tried something a little different. I did the same thing Jan did with , but then I tried it by putting a 2 in front and used . This time it didn't go to 1, but went to 2.828 something. So, it looks like it can go to things other than 1. Can we make up a function that will go to any number we want?    Describe the central mathematical issues involved in the classroom exchange.

This illustrates values of an infinite sequence where each element of the sequence is obtained by taking the previous element in the sequence and plugging it into a given function. In this investigation we will explore such sequences and look for common properties.   Problem Statement : In the example given above, a specific function, , and a specific starting point, , were used to generate the sequence. In this exploration, consider a more general question. Suppose you have a function and the infinite sequence, . In this exploration, we will examine this sequence for some specific families of functions and then generate more questions for further investigation.         Here we will use the TI-Nspire CX II CAS , but this can also be done with a variety of other computer algebra systems. To begin, we will explore a very familiar function, , for various values of the parameter, . Open a new document and select 1:New Document . When prompted, select 2:Add Graphs to open a graphing screen. Enter the function in the command line at the bottom of the screen and press [enter] to display the graph. You will be able to morph this graph later by grabbing it in order to explore the effect of the parameter, , on the sequence.    1st set of screenshots    In order to observe the behavior of this sequence graphically, generate a sequence plot by plotting the term number vs. the iterate values. To do this, insert a new page by pressing ctrl  +page and then selecting 2:Add Graphs . In this case, you do not want to graph a function, but the sequence points. To change the type of graph, press menu and then select 3:Graph Entry\/Edit followed by 7:Sequence and 1:Sequence . You will notice that the command line at the top of the screen will change yielding fields into which you can enter the sequence relationship and initial value (see images below). Since we want to generate an iterative sequence based on the function stored in , we enter so that the sequence plotter will use the function value of the pervious number in the sequence to generate the new number in the sequence. Use 0.5 as your initial value for now. You can adjust the viewing window by grabbing a tick mark on the axis by holding down the \"click\/grab\" key located in the center of the NavPad (mouse pad) until the hand closes. Dragging your finger across the NavPad will adjust the view. If you want to adjust only one axis scale at a time, simply hold down the shift key while you move on the screen. To adjust where the axes are located within the window, move to any open space in the graphing window and hold the \"click\/grab\" key down until the hand closes, then move the entire graph to any location you desire (see images below).    2nd set of screenshots      3rd set of screenshots    In order to explore the relationship between the parameter, , and the behavior of the sequence, it will be helpful to view the function and the sequence plot side-by-side. In order to do this press +page to insert a new page and then press esc since you do not wish to insert just one application, but two in a side-by-side layout. Now press doc and select 5:Page Layout and 2:Select Layout followed by 2:Layout 2 . This will give a side-by-side partitioned screen that will allow you to place a different application in each partition.    4th set of screenshots      5th set of screenshots    In order to copy the graph page for both the function and the scatter plot, you must first select them. Page back to the function graph by pressing ctrl followed by the left arrow until you get to the page you want. Unfortunately you cannot just copy the page, but must “select” it first. To do this, press doc and then select 5:Page Layout followed by 3:Select App . In the future, the shortcut for selecting an application is ctrl  K . You will see the border of the screen begin to flash indicating it is selected. Then press ctrl  C to copy it (just like on a computer). Now page back to the split screen by pressing ctrl followed by the right arrow until you reach it. To paste the graphing screen into the left side, just press ctrl  V (like paste on a computer). To get the sequence plot pasted into the right side of the screen, repeat this process, but you will need to click on the right side of the screen to make it active before pasting. You will know that a portion of the screen is active since it will have a darkened border around it (see screens below).    6th set of screenshots    At this point you are ready to examine the effects of the parameter, , on the behavior of the sequence. The side-by-side view of the two graphs allows you to manipulate the function and see the sequence plot change dynamically in real time. To do this, move the cursor to the edge of the parabola until you see the dilation icon appear as shown below. Press and hold the click key until the \"hand\" closes to grab the parabola then use the arrow keys to “morph” it. To \"let go\" just press esc .    Sketch the graphs for at least four different values of in . Describe any patterns you may see. Will the sequence always converge?  As you have seen, the parameter, , affects the behavior of the sequence. Are there other factors that also affect the behavior of the sequence? You may have already considered the possibility that the “seed”, or initial, value might also affect it. At this point change the seed value and investigate how the parameter, , and the seed value interact. You can change the seed by clicking in the sequence window and editing the initial term or by grabbing the initial point (green) in the sequence plot and moving it or editing it directly in the command line. To make the command line visible, press ctrl  G or double click in any white space in the window.    7th set of screenshots      Record your data for at least two other seed values and the corresponding different values of for each seed sketching your plots. Does there appear to be a relationship between the seed and a? Describe any patterns you may see.  Since we will want to explore the effects of the seed value for multiple trials, it will make it easier to place an editable seed value on the graphing page. To do this, on the graphing page containing the parabola, select menu and then 1:Actions followed by B:Insert Slider . Type the variable name, , into the slider Variable dialogue box and press enter . You can place the slider anywhere in the window and elongate it by grabbing the dot on either end. To adjust the slider after it is set in place, click on the slider box and press ctrl  menu to open the attributes and select 1:Move to move location or 2:Settings and edit the settings as you wish. You can also change the slider settings to allow finer step sizes when dragging (below shows changing it to 0.01).    8th set of screenshots    Now to connect the slider to the sequence plot, edit the sequence plot setting as you did before so that the Initial Term simply reads, seed . This will now allow you to change the seed value on the graphing page for the function. You can also move the slider to a convenient place on the screen so that it is not interfering with the view of the graph.    9th set of screenshots      Investigate other combinations of and the . Record your data and sketches. Does there appear to be a relationship between the seed and ? Describe any patterns you may see. Based on your observations, can you predict whether or not the sequence will converge?    Repeat your process from part (c) for another seed value recording your data and sketches. Did your second choice of seed value confirm or refute any earlier conjectures? Explain.  Although we may have a conjecture at this point, we still need to prove that this conjecture will always hold. To accomplish this, we turn to the algebraic representation. Open a new Calculator page by pressing ctrl  +page and selecting 1:Add Calculator . Define the function by pressing menu and selecting 1:Actions followed by 1:Define . Then enter the function, keeping in mind that implied multiplication is not recognized between two letters and that you must use the [ ] key. We can explore a few cases for on the Calculator page (see below).    10th set of screenshots    Since the spreadsheet in the CAS allows symbolic entries, we can use the Generate Sequence feature to look at repeated iterations of the function composition. To do this, insert a new 4:Lists & Spreadsheet page. Give the first column a title of, . Now generate the sequence of compositions as shown below by entering in the first open cell. In cell A2, enter just as you would in Excel. You will see an algebraic result appear. Now move your cursor to the bottom right corner of the cell until you see a appear and click and drag down the column to perform a “fill down”. You should see expressions appear (see below).    11th set of screenshots      Examining several different iterations of composed with itself, describe any patterns you see. How might we prove any patterns that you may observe will always hold?    Enter several different iterations of composed with itself where instead of the initial input being , the input is . What output do you get for each case you try? How do the input and output compare?   "

[ Sarah allows the students to spend about 20 minutes building some models and recording some data. ]   Sarah : OK, let's see what you've come up with. [ Sarah draws a group number out of her bucket to determine which gorup will report out ]. Group 4. What did you find?   Cait : Well, we just noticed that when we built them, we could just take the staircase that we built before and put a row on the bottom that was just one block more than the bottom of the staircase.   Sarah : Nice observation. Did any other groups notice any other patterns? Yeah, Ben?   Ben : We just built a bunch and wrote the total blocks in a table. At first we thought it might be an arithmetic sequence and it kind of was, but not.   Sarah : What do you mean, \"...it kind of was, but not.\"?   Ben : Well, when we subtracted we didn't get a common difference, but did get a pattern.   Sarah : Can you describe your pattern?   Ben : Instead of the numbers always being the same, they just kept getting bigger. You know... one at a time. Like at first the difference was 2, then 3, then 4, and so on. So it was kind of arithmetic, but it was the differences that was arithmetic because those all had a change of 1. You know, from 2 to 3 is 1, then from 3 to 4 is 1, and from 4 to 5 is also 1.   Sarah : That's kind of interesting. Is this connected to Cait's group in any way? Yeah, Liam?   Liam [ from Cait's group ]: Ben's numbers are just what we were sayin'. His numbers in his differences were just going up by one like us when we were sayin' we added a row on the botton that was one more than the one that came before.    In your groups, discuss what you would do to lead the next stage of the discussion. Keep in mind that Sarah ultimately wants to have the students move beyond a recursive method of computing the total number of block toward a \"closed form\" expression where they could just plug the height of the staircase into the expression and get the total number of blocks out.    Now that you have discussed what you might do from a pedagogical perspective, try to find a \"closed form\" expression. Ultimately, you will need to try and prove your expression will always work. Be prepared to share your strategies with the rest of the class.   Consider two different approaches. For the first, create a scatterplot of the data and perform a regression. For the second approach, construct two staircases of the same height and consider how they might fit together like a puzzle.    Based on the two different approaches from part (b), how might the method you use influence the way you might try to prove the pattern will always work?   Consider viewing things as triangles or rectangles.   "

  "body": " Introduction to Vectors and Matrices   Imagine you are standing in an unfamiliar forest and seeking a way out. You can see the sun and know the approximate time of day and know that your parked car is on the northmost edge of the forest. How do you navigate your way toward your car? Do you need to know your exact location or do you simply need to identify a direction you need to go from your current location? This question involves the idea of a direction and \"magnitude\" meaning the length of your path. This is one use of objects called vectors . While this interpretation of vector is a commonly use, there are other ways vectors can describe other phenomena. Here we will examine the concept of vectors as well as matrices (a kind of super vector) that can store information that vectors can use.    Modeling Data and Moving Between Worlds   The Common Core State Standards include the teaching of vectors and matrices, although not all aspects of these concepts are expected for all student who graduate high school. Many of the more complex uses of vectors and matrices are left for those planning to enter mathematically rigorous fields of study at the university level. The CCSS denote this by placing a (+) next to the standard that is not intended for all students (see ).    CCSS: Vectors and Matrices   CCSS: Vectors and Matrices        Jason is teaching an Algebra 2 class and is introducing a unit on vectors and matrices. To motivate the topics, he has created a project where students are working for a company that sells products to other companies and must manage the relationship between the price they charge for their products and the revenue they can generate from sales. He begins class by posing the task.   Jason : Today we are going to deal with a problem that many businesses face. How do you set prices for your products and what effects do those decisions have on the revenue you get from your consumers? Suppose we have a company that sells T-shirts to three main stores: Total Tees , T-Riffic , and T-Rex . Our company mass produces four basic prints of T-shirts. Let's call them T1 , T2 , T3 , and T4 . On the board, I have put the orders for each type of T-shirt for each of the three stores.    Jason's List of T-Shirt Orders   Jason's List of T-Shirt Orders     We want to be able to work with various options of pricing for the different shirts as the demand warrants. For example, if one particular print gaiin popularity, we might want to raise its cost to the stores since there is higher demand. If another print is less popular, we may want to lower the price we charge the stores to encourage more demand. Long-story-short, we want to develop a way to calculate the revenue we get from each store as we tweak the prices we charge for the different shirts. Does anyone have any questions? Yeah, Bri?   Bri : So what you're saying is that if we have the prices, we want to be able to quickly find the total amount we get from each store? With the orders you put on the board?   Jason : Yep. You got it!   Nic : What if the orders change?   Jason : Excellent question! Let's just assume the orders stay the same here and we are just messing with the prices for now. Make a note, though, Nic, and we'll come back to your idea later.   Rosa : Can we have some prices to start? I'd like to have some prices so I can do some calculations to see what's happening.   Jason : OK, how about saying that we charge $12 for T1, $9 for T2, $10 for T3, and $8 for T4. Will that work?   Rosa : Thanks. That'll give us somewhere to start.   Jason : Great, now go ahead in your groups and talk about how you might go about this. Feel free to use any tools we usually have in class like your computer or CAS.  [ Jason allows the students about 20 minutes to start talking about ways to handle the situation. As he circulates, Jason notices Mia's group working with their CAS to take a functional approach to deal with problem. He makes a note to have Mia share when the class comes back together for discussion. Jason also notes that Nic's group seems to holding onto Nic's earlier comment about changing orders and have started to explore the problem with a spreadsheet. Jason was happy to see Nic's group's approach as he thinks it will help him transition eventually to defining multiplication between a matrix and a vector. After time for exploration, Jason brings the class back together to share ideas. ]   Jason : So what did you try? Anyone want to go first? Yeah, Mia?   Mia : Well, we kinda used our CAS to define functions for each store. We can put the in the functions and it gives us the money we get froom them.   Jason : The revenue?   Mia : Yeah, I guess.   Jason : Can I show your calculator on the display?   Mia : Yeah, I'm logged in.  [ Jason displays Mia's calculator through the wireless network. (see )]    Mia's Group's Defined Functions   Mia's Group's Defined Functions      Jason : Tell us what everything is.   Mia : Well, the tt is for orders for Totally Tees, tr is for T-Riffic, and tx is for T-Rex. We just used w,x,y, and z for the placeholders for the prices so we can just enter them in the functions.   Jason : Great idea. Can you show us how you would calculate the revenue.   Mia : Sure, just put in 12, 9, 10, and 8 in the functions and you get ...    Mia's Group's Defined Functions   Mia's Group's Functions with Prices      Jason : That's a neat way to do it so you don't have to keep doing the same thing on your calculator and retyping the orders. With my luck, I'd retype something wrong anyway.   Vero : We kinda did something like that, but when our group was talking, Nic was sharing more about what he said earlier and we came up with something that lets us change more than the prices.   Jason : Can you share it? Can I put your calculator on the display?   Vero : I didn't do it on the calculator, but we used our Chromebooks. Can I plug it in?   Jason : Sure, bring it up.  [ Vero brings her laptop up to the front and plugs it in to get  ]    Vero's Group's Spreadsheet with Orders and Prices   Vero's Group's Spreadsheet with Orders and Prices     [ Jason smiles. He can't believe his luck that Vero's group formatted the spreadsheet the way they did with the prices listed vertically. As he looks at the command line for formatting the computation, the colored entries match his plans for later in the lesson. ]    In your groups, discuss your thoughts on the two approaches. How are they the same? How are they different? Summarize your thoughts on your whiteboards.    If you were in Jason's position, how would you link the approaches of Mia's and Vero's groups? What would you do next to make the connection? What common mathematical concept(s) are being used here?    In the episode, Jason begins to smile as he sees the method that Vero's group used. Why do you think he was smiling? Where will he take the lesson next? How does Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno's model apply here and how is it \"playing into Jason's hand\"?    In looking at Vero's spreadsheet, discuss in your groups how a spreadsheet might be a useful tool with young learners (elementary school) to introduce the concept of variable.     In this section we will look at linear algebra as a way to encode information and operate on it allowing us to move between different sets of information. To this end, we will define how matrices and vectors are operated on with binary operations like addition and multiplication. While multiplication of matrices may seem weird at first, you will see that it is defined as it is for convenience in manipulating data and transforming different types of values into other computed values based on them. We begin by considering a case where we want to move between a pricing scheme and the revenue it generates for three different companies with three different sets of orders of our products.  To accomplish this, we will use constructs created to deal with objects that contain multiple entries. In the scenario we are using where companies place orders for products, we want to encode the numerical values for the orders organizing them according to the product and company placing the order. Here just want to reduce the information to an array of values and so we define a matrix as an array of values (or objects) consisting of rows and columns. We typically contain these values with brackets or parentheses like: In the matrices above, the columns could represent the numbers of each of four products being ordered and the rows could represent the three different companies placing the orders (see the table of orders for this situation given in ).  We also define a vector as matrix with a single column such as or . Note that we are using boldface to denote the names of the vectors for convenience to distinguish them from numerical objects that we call scalars . In a text like this, using boldface makes sense in print, but typically, in written work, we use a harpoon over the name since boldface is not practical with a pen. In this case, we would write the names as or respectively.  You may have encountered vectors before in geometry or physics. We will go into greater detail later with respect to the geometric interpretation, but for now, the behavior remains the same in that operations still work as they do in geometry and physics. Essentially, vectors consist of components so that when the vectors are added, we simply add the components.     If and are vectors, we define vector addition as adding the vectors component by component. Note that the vectors must be of the same dimension.      For example, suppose we have the two vectors in , . Adding these would result in .  The other basic operation we can do with vectors is to scale them (geometrically make them longer or shorter or in the case of negative values, make them go in the opposite direction). For this reason, when we multiply the vector by a numerical value, we call that value a scalar . For example, In essence, we scaled the vector by a factor of 2.     In general, we can define scalar multiplication of a vector as where .     Combining scalar multiplication with vector addition, we get We can use these linear combinations applying them to our previous scenario for moving between price of materials and the revenue they generate.    Working with Vectors   As we begin to work with vectors, we should examine how basic operations with them work both numberically and geometrically. Here we will first look at vector addition and then scalar multiplication.    In , we defined an addition for vectors based on component-wise addition. Consider the vectors in , and . Numerically add these two vectors in two ways, first and then . Give your result in each case and describe what you notice.    On the grid in , plot both and as directed line segments (i.e. arrows). Also plot the results you obtained for and . In your groups, discuss how you might interpret movement from the origin along and to arrive at the location of and . How is the interpretation of movement different depending on whether you are using or ? Sketch the directed movement as a combination of two vectors (arrows) for each case.    Grid for Vector Addition   Grid for Adding Vectors       In , we defined scalar multiplication for vectors based on component-wise multiplication by the same scalar (number). Consider the vector in , . Numerically multiply this vector by the scalars , , and . Give your result in each case.    On the grid in , plot and as directed line segments (i.e. arrows) for each value of . Describe what you notice about all of these results.   Grid for Vector Addition   Grid for Adding Vectors           Linear Combinations and Dealing with Data  Continuing our scenario from the introduction. Suppose that a supplier provides four different products with prices, , to three companies. One thing we may want to do is to play with pricing schemes and look at the generated revenue we would get from each of the three companies. Suppose we have orders from the three companies for each of our four products as given in the table below.    Product Orders    Clients  Product 1  Product 2  Product 3  Product 4    Company 1  14  9  34  41    Company 2  32  7  12  52    Company 3  21  8  5  23        Prices, Vectors, and Revenue   Consider the scenario given above for the orders by three companies for four different products.    Thinking of the four Products from as each being a vector where the entries of the vector store the orders made for each of the three companies, express this information as a set of four vectors in .   Since there are four Products , we can express the orders from the three companies for each Product as an ordered triple (or vector) containing three entries (one for each company) for that product. This would give us a set of four vectors:     If Product 1 is priced at $12, Product 2 is priced at $9, Product 3 is priced at $15, and Product 4 is priced at $7, using these prices for each of the four Products in the table as scalars, write a linear combination of the vectors from your set from part (a) that when added will give a vector in that represents the revenue generated from each company. How much did you collect from each company? Feel free to use your CAS to do the computation here.    This means we received $1046 from Company 1, $991 from Company 2, and $560 from Company 3.    Since you allowed your CAS to do the computation for part (b), let's think about how it is doing the arithmetic. Using what we have defined for combining scalar multiplication and vector addition in Equation 1.1.2, show the details of how the CAS was computing the resulting vector that you obtained in part (b).           In general, we can think of the selling price for each of the four Products as scalars . Give a general expression in terms of for the revenue generated by the purchases for the three companies expressing them as a linear combination of three-entry revenue vectors (one entry for each company) resulting in the revenue vector, .         Notice that where the product and sum are combined in part (c) we have the scalar values (or prices) of each Product ($12, $9, $15, and $7) being multipled by all entries in their respective vectors where the number of orders of each Product is placed in the vector in order by the company. When these vectors are then added, we get the total revenue for each company organized as an ordered triple (since there are three companies).  Here we are purposefully using an example where the number of entries in each set of values of interest (prices and revenue) are different to highlight that although we can have the same number of entries in each set be the same, it is not necessary. Eventually we will express the prices as a vector consisting of four entries and the revenue as a vector consisting of three entries where we can think of the process of going from prices to revenue as a transformation between worlds so to speak. In this case we will have four entries in one set of vectors\/world (prices of different Products) meaning that these vectors exist in such as and three entries in the other set of vectors\/world (revenue from each of the three companies) existing in like .  In the previous activity, you may have noticed behaviors of the arithmetic when working with the vectors and scalars that are familiar. From your basic experiences in elementary school, you will recall some properties for operating on numbers that seem to also be happening in your work with vectors. Let's explore these briefly by using the properties of vector addition and scalar multiplication we have just defined.    Structure of Vectors   Consider the vectors , , and . Define each of these vectors in your computer algebra system (CAS).    Based on what we know about how we have defined vector addition and the fact that all of these vectors are in , when we add any two of them we will get another vector in . However, what other properties hold? Using your CAS, compute and then compute . Describe what you notice? Have you seen this behavior before with real numbers? What is this property called?    Using your CAS, compute , first by computing and then adding to your result. Now compute , first by computing and then adding your result to . Describe what you notice? Have you seen this behavior before with real numbers? What is this property called?    Using each of the vectors, , , and , add the vector to each. Describe what you notice. Have you seen this behavior before with real numbers? What is this property called?    Using each of the vectors, , , and , negate each entry of and add the resulting vector to . Describe what you notice. Repeat this process with and . Do you get similar results? Have you seen this behavior before with real numbers? What is this property called?    Using your CAS, compute , first by computing and then multiplying 2 times your result. Now compute , first by computing 2 times each vector and then adding your results together. Describe what you notice? Have you seen this behavior before with real numbers? What is this property called?    Given that , compute and . Describe what you notice? Have you seen this behavior before with real numbers? What is this property called?    Using your CAS, compute , first by computing and then multiplying 2 times your result. Now compute , first by computing 2 times 3 and then multiplying your result by . Describe what you notice? Have you seen this behavior before with real numbers? What is this property called?     Since we have seen these properties before from our work with real numbers, we can use them with vectors and scalars so that we can manipulate these combinations of operations. To this end, we can define a \"world\" where objects like vectors and scalars behave in a way that we expect and can use.    Vector Space   A vector space is a nonempty set of objects, called vectors , on which are defined two operations, called addition and scalar multiplication (for real numbers), that satisfy the following axioms. For any and :                  There exists a zero vector , denoted , such that .    For each , there exists a vector denoted such that .    The scalar multiple of by , denoted .                              Transforming Data and Matrix Multiplication  As we have seen, we can use vectors to represent any entity that might have multiple components. This allows us to manipulate values of common components by adding or multiplying them while keeping the components separated in the process. This use of linear combinations of vectors is useful, but the real desire of the previous scenario is to examine how manipulating one set of values (say, prices of products) affects another set of values (revenue from each company). Just as we explored functional relationships in algebra and calculus, we also might want to explore functional relationships with objects that have not just one value as an input and one corresponding value as an output, but rather inputs that have many component values and a corresponding output that also has many component values.  Recall that one of our first experiences with functions dealt with simple linear relationships. For example, Hooke's Law states that there is a simple linear relationship between force on a stretched or compressed spring and the distance of the associated stretch or compression, , where is a constant of proportionality. If we use function notation to express that force, , is a function of stretch, , we indicate the independent variable by placing it in parentheses getting, .  In this situation, we obtain the force as an output by multiplying the stretch, , by a numerical value, . What if in our scenario for the relationship between pricing of products and the revenue generated from each of our three companies, we could have a simple multiplication by something that acted like in our Hooke's Law relationship? In the case, there is a single value, , that affects the output, , for a given input, . However, in the situation with price vs revenue, there are many values impacting the output of revenue for an input vector of prices (namely, all of the different order values provided by the companies placing orders). So, our k -equivalent must take into account all of the values of the orders placed by the companies. Here we can think of our single multiplier (like that of ) as being comprised of an array of order values for the products like we had for the linear combination of the vectors except now we express this set of vectors as a single matrix where each column is a vector (called a column vector ). This gives an entity (matrix) that serves the role that did in .  What this does for us is it allows us to think of the scalars (prices) we used in the linear combination, as an input vector, , so that we get a relationship that is structurally similar to : where acts like , acts like , and acts like .  The use of a matrix as a single entity that we can use to multiply by a vector brings an interesting question. What does it mean to multiply by a matrix? If we look at what we want to do from our functional perspective in the case above, we would like to have the outputs represent the revenue in the way we ultimately added them up in the linear combination of the vectors with the prices viewed as scalars for the column vectors in the matrix. This means that we will need to define the multiplication of a matrix and a vector in such a way that we get:  Now this may seem complicated, but one way to look at the process is that we proceed across a row in the matrix while moving down the vector component by component adding the products of the row entries of the matrix and the corresponding component entries of the vector. For example, for the top entry in the resulting revenue vector, we obtained it by moving across the first row with values 14, 9, 34, and 41, while multiplying each by their respective position price value , , , and and then adding these four products together. This gives . Now we proceed similarly for each row moving across the row and down the vector creating product combinations and adding them together as we go. The row of the matrix we use for the computation becomes the row position in the resulting vector we are creating (in this case, revenue). You will likely notice that the result of the way we have chosen to define the multiplication of a matrix and a vector only makes sense if the number of columns of the matrix matches the number of entries (rows of components) of the vector.    Transformations of Vectors  Now that we have defined what it means to multiply a matrix and a vector, we can go back to the concept that motivated it, namely, the desire to move between an input vector and an output vector. In a way, we are looking to transform one type of vector into another type of vector. When we think of our example of Hooke's Law as transforming stretch or compression into force, we note that this happens in our daily lives and we are not often even aware it is there.  Consider a trip to the grocery store. In the produce aisle, we take zucchini and place them on a scale. In turn, the scale returns a weight (force) in pounds (if you are in the USA) or mass in kilograms (practically anywhere else in the world). Inside the scale, there is a spring that is being compressed or stretched. This value is then transformed into a value of weight or mass using Hooke's Law. In fact, it is more likely the case that you are more familiar with a transformation in form of cost instead of weight or mass as most digital scales today allow us to scan the scale's output barcode registering a cost in our \"shop and scan\" app. Below is a video illustrating this process.     The Produce Aisle: Concept of Linear Transformation    So what are the characteristics of this type of transformation? Consider the case from the video where we saw that the doubling the force (or mass) corresponded in the doubling of the stretch. Similarly, tripling the force would triple the stretch. In general, this means that any multiple of stretch will correspond to the same multiple of force (or mass or cost) depending on the output we desire for the transformation. We can see this from the basic algebra from Hooke's Law. What this says is that scalar multiplication is preserved .  Now this is all well and good if we are looking at replicating the same stretch multiple times (e.g. all of our zucchini are the exact same weight), but what about the case where we have multiple numbers of zucchini of varying weight (corresponding to varying stretches)? We also want to have it be the case that if we place two different \"stretch\" zucchinis on the scale that the resulting weight will simply be added together as well so that their corresponding costs will also be added together (since we are paying based on the cost\/unit weight). In this case, suppose we have two possibly different stretches , and . Here we get What this says is that vector addition is preserved . In this case, we can think of the inputs, and , as vectors with only one component. In fact, if you have ever taken a physics class, you will recall that both force and stretch in Hook'e Law were considered vectors since along a single line we associate a positive and negative direction for these values to indicate direction of the force or stretch. We often represent this relationship as a vector relationship, or .  Recall from your Algebra 1 days, a function like is the most basic of linear functions. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that these two aspects of behavior (preservation of scalar multiplication and vector addition) by this type of function are the defining properties of what we call linear transformations .     In the case of the force and spring stretch, we had a spring constant, , as our constant of proportionality where it was a single value that worked for a specific spring. As we have seen, we may have relationships where this \"constant\" is actually dependent on many different values instead of a single one (i.e. a matrix of values). Can we still have these two operations (scalar multiplication and vector addition) work when the thing we are multiplying the vectors by is a matrix? Suppose we have a matrix transformation given by . Define this transformation in your CAS and then define and .

Does your earlier observation hold for any two vectors in ? Explain.    Using, , to represent any real number, find expressions for and . Does your observation from part (c) hold for all vectors in ? Explain.    Given how we defined matrix-vector multiplication out of linear combiinations, come up with an argument for why all such matrix transformations must be  preserving both scalar multiplication and vector addition.       Linear Transformation   Suppose is a mapping between and , ( and need not be distinct) such that both scalar multiplication and vector addition are preserved.  where , and is a scalar. Then the mapping is called linear or a linear transformation .     Just as the relationship of Hooke's Law can be thought of as transforming stretch into force , in our scenario between pricing structures and the revenue generated, we are similarly looking to transform a pricing scheme into the resulting revenue for our three companies. We can even use function notation to represent this relationship. If we let the vector , we can think of the product of the matrix of orders by the companies and the vector as a revenue transformation (or function), , given by This is effectively a mapping between vectors in and vectors in . We can represent this mapping as .    Price to Revenue: Linear Transformation?   In the previous activity, we illustrated how we can show that a matrix transformation between the same spaces ( to ) is, in fact, a linear transformation. In this activity, let's take a similar approach to show we can also make the same claim for mappings between different spaces ( to ). Here we will use our earlier example of transforming price scenarios into revenues for our three companies.    Consider the transformation , where . Find expressions for and . Is scalar multiplication preserved for all vectors in ? Explain.    To see if preservation of vector addition holds in general for this particular matrix, create two vectors on your CAS , and . Using your CAS, find expressions for and . Is vector addition preserved for any two vectors in ? Explain.        If is a linear transformation, then it must map the zero vector from the domain to the zero vector in the range. In other words, .    Suppose is a linear transformation and . Well since , we know that where here is in . Since vector addition is preserved, we get that this is equal to . Again, as a linear transformation, we know that scalar multiplication is also preserved and so and thus where here is in .     We began this section looking at how we can represent practical data and relationships using matrices and vectors along with operations allowing us to transform one type of vector into another. In the next few sections, we will extend this view to consider geometric representations that have far reaching applications into areas such as digital file compression and image detection. Eveytime you access your phone using facial recognition, you are using linear algebra. Vectors and matrices play a key role in your everyday life and you may not even be aware of it!     Solving Systems of Equations   In this subsection we will explore processes surrounding solving systems of linear equations. In the last section, we ended by experimenting with various scalars to determine if a set of vectors were linearly independent. Mostly we used trial and error or tried to reduce the linear combinations by chosing a value for one of the scalars and then working backwards to find the remaining scalars. This was a time-consuming process and can often be challenging if there is a unique solution. In this section, we will try a more systematic approach that will help us find the desired scalars more efficiently.    Finding Scalars: Gaussian Elimination  As we ended section 2.1, we wanted to establish whether or not a set of vectors was linealry independent. To do this, we needed to determine whether or not we could find a set of scalar values that would give us a linear combination for other vectors in the set. In addition, we sought to determine the if a vector was in the Span of a set of vectors. For both of these questions, we ultimately want to solve for specific scalars that would meet our desired requirements.  While this process of finding scalars may seem new, it is actually not a new idea. Recall that in high school we solved systems of equations using a variety of techniques including substitution, elimination, and graphing. As the number of variables and equations increased, the techniques of substitution and graphing became very challenging. The process of elimination was generally easier as the number of variables increased and so this process is the one we will refine here.  You may recall that there were certain operations we could perform on equations so that their solution sets did not change. These included multiplying an equation by a nonzero constant, adding equals to equals, and rearranging the equations. For example, since, say, , we can also say that . Similarly for an equation like (for which a solution is clearly and ), then if we multiply both sides by, say 3, we get . Just as and is a solution to the original equation, due to the fact that multiplying both sides of an equation by the same value gives a new equation that is also true, and is also a solution to (i.e. ).  In a similar fashion, if we start with and add the same amount to both sides, we get . If we plug in and we get . In both cases, if we start with an equation with a certain solution, adding the same constant to both sides or multiplying both sides by the same constant will give a new equation for which the solution to the original equation will be a solution to the new equation.  What if we want to add expressions to both sides of an equation? Consider another equation, , that also has a common solution, and . If we add this equation to or earlier equation, , we get where and is still a solution to the result, (see ). What this tells us is that if we seek solutions to a system of equations, we can add any of the equations in the system to each other and get a new equation that also shares the same solution(s) as the previous equations.    Three Lines   (for accessibility)     So now suppose we did not know that the solution to our earlier set of equations, and , was and . How do these manipulations that yield new equations with the same solution help us? As you may recall from your earlier mathematics experiences, we can take the approach of trying to \"eliminate\" a variable from the system so that we can more easily solve for one of the variables. In this case, consider what would happen if we multipled the top equation by -4. This would give us a new equation, , and we can use it in place of the original one. Why multiply it by -4? As we saw, if two equations share the same solution(s), we can add them and the resulting equation will also have the same solution(s). The -4 was selected since it will give a coefficient of that is the opposite of the coefficient of in the second equation so that when added they will cancel each other to leave us only the variable .   Now we can simply plug into either of our original equations to get a value for . Let's use the first equation as it is easier to solve for . This gives which yields .   Now consider the following example where we use this process to find scalars for a linear combination of vectors.     Finding Scalars  Consider a more simplified version of our scenario from Chapter 1 involving prices, and revenue for products we are selling to various companies. In this case, we consider fewer companies and products to make this example easier to disect. Suppose we have the following data for the number of items for two different products for two different companies.    Product Orders    Clients  Product 1  Product 2    Company 1  2  3    Company 2  1  5      In this case we are looking for scalars for prices, and , that provide desired revenues, and . This gives the following vector equation.     A question we might ask is what prices do we need to set so that we have revenue of $43 from Company 1 and $46 from Company 2? It may be that there are no such price combinations that will yield what we want (i.e. does this combination exist?). There may be a case where there are infinitely many such price combinations (i.e. there is not uniqueness). These two fundamental questions of existence and uniqueness will be ones we revisit as we seek solutions to equations.  So now we ask if we can find solutions to the vector equation, ?  However, this is not such an unusual task. Recall from high algebra we solved these equations before, but they were simply written in a different form. This vector equation could also be written as    Now we can use the process of Gaussian elimination to reduce these equations to only one variable. Suppose we multiply the second equation by and add the resulting equations to obtain the following.     Now we can use our value for in one of our original equations (let's use the second one since it is easier) to get which gives .  Checking this result we get .       Consider the following system of equations.       Use the process of Gaussian elimination to reduce the system of 3 equations and 3 unknowns to a system of 2 equations and 2 unknowns by scaling and\/or adding pairs of these equations.    Now eliminate another of your two remaining variables from part (a) in similar manner (scaling and\/or adding pairs of these equations) to find a solution value for one of the three variables.    Use your value from part (b) and one of your equations found in part (a) to solve for a second unknown.    Use the two values you have found so far along with one of your original equations to solve for the last unknown.    Use the GeoGebra applet in to verify your solution to the system. Feel free to rotate the planes so that the intersection point of all three is visible.    3D System of Equations        Now that we have worked through a process to reduce a system of equations to fewer and fewer variables, we can summarize the operations that changed the look of the equations without changing the solutions. We essentially have three types of \"moves\" we can do that will create equivalent systems of equations that maintain the same solutions as the original system.     Scaling   In this situation, we can multiply an entire equation by a constant and not change the solutions. For example, will have the same solutions as the original, .       Swapping   Here we are allowing the position of the listed equations within the system to be simply swapped. This principle is kind of obvious since the two systems of equations clearly have the same solution!       Replacing   In this situation, we found that if we multiply one equation by a scalar (even if it is just 1) and add it to another equation and use this result in place of the equation we added the scalar multiple to, the solutions to the system remain the same. For example, we can take a system like and take, say 3, times the bottom equation and add it to the top equation replacing the top equation with this result to get and we will still have the same solution, and , be the solution to both systems.        As you may have noticed in both of these examples for solving a system with Gaussian elimination, to make it easier to manipulate and perform operations on the equations, we made it a practice to keep the variables aligned with each other and then performed the multiplication by scalars and addition of equations using the three \"moves\" described above. This helped us make sure we were not accidently adding the coefficients of different variables together. For the most part, this practice just makes \"bookkeeping\" easier. This should sound kind of familiar. We did the same thing in Chapter 1 when we introduced vectors and matrices. We viewed these arrays of elements as an easier way to keep track of corresponding components that represented values for the same type of quantities (e.g. orders of the same product, price of the same product, revenue from the same company) without needing to label them. So the natural question is, do we need to write the variable name if we already know which variable is associated with which column in our \"stacked\" representation of the equations? The answer is a resounding, no! So let's consider what would happen if we were to forego the writing of the variable names.    Augmented Matrices and Stripping Away Variable Names  When we look at the general structure we have been using for our equations in the Guassian elimination process, we wanted our equations to be of the form, , where the variables are all on the left side of the equation and the right side contains only a numerical value. If we assume this structure for our equations, we can define them in the following way.    A linear equation in the variables, may be written in the form where the real numbers represented by are called coefficients and is a constant real number.  When we have several such equations that share common variables, we say that it is a system of linear equations or, more simply, a linear system .    Recall from , we began by looking at systems of equations from the standpoint of transformations.   Here we are separating out the variable names into a single vector and the coefficients are isolated into a matrix. If you wanted to give a name to this matrix, you might call it...you guessed it, a coefficient matrix .    From Equations to Matrix Transformation   Consider the following system of equations.       Express this system of equations as a coefficient matrix multiplied by a vector that is equal to another vector.    Use your System of Equations command on your CAS to solve this system for , , and .    Use the solutions you found in part (b) to show that the matrix-vector equation you created in part (a) is true by multiplying your coefficient matrix by the vector made up of the components from your solutions.     In the last activity, you took a system of equations and converted it into a coefficient matrix, a vector whose components represented the variables, and another vector whose components represented the values from the right-hand side of the equations. From Chapter 1, we viewed these equations as transformations and in this section we used Gaussian elimination to find solutions for the variables in the equations (see and ). So how are these connected? Think back to our use of Gaussian elimination. What did we really manipulate? We kept the variables aligned for convenience and multiplied entire equations by scalar values and from time to time added equations together. However, the only things we really changed in the process were the values of the coefficients (the very things that become isloated in the coefficient matrix in our transformation version of the equations). So the natural question is, why do we waste our time writing down the variable names if we are just going to keep them aligned anyway. Instead, why don't we simply work with the numerical values of the coefficients?  To enable us to more easily work with the solution process, we can tweak our coefficient matrix just a bit, so that the numerical values from the right-hand side of our equations (which do change as we manipilate) are also included. We can simply augment our coefficient matrix with these values. Consider the system of equations given below. We can use the processes of scaling equations and adding them together like in to try and simplify the system to find solutions.     In this case we can create the coefficient matrix and then augment it with an additional column containing the values from the right-hand side of the equations. In this case we get     Once we have reduced the equations to an augmented matrix with the coefficients on the left side of the bar and the numerical values from the right side of the equations on the right side of the bar, we can use the process we used earlier to operate on the matrix and reduce it to a simplified form. Recall that before, we wanted to eliminate variables so that we could get an equation with just one variable in it. Here we will do the same, but instead, we wish to manipulate the matrix so that we have entries that are zero in locations (this is like eliminating the variable from that particular equation). Note that the rows represent equations and the columns represent the variables, , , and , respectively.  Suppose we want to eliminate the variable, , from the second row (equation). As we did earlier, we can multiply the first row (equation) by and add it to the second row and use the new resulting row (equation) to replace the old version of the second row. This would give us the following.     This can also be done step-by-step on most basic graphing calculators. In this case, the first entry in the command is the scalar (-4), followed by the matrix, then the row that is being scaled (row 1), and finally the row that is being added to and thus (row 3).    Using CAS Stage 1    Now we can do the same thing for the third row multiplying Row 1 by and adding it to Row 3 and replacing Row 3 with the result.       Using CAS Stage 1    At this point, we can begin to back-solve since the last row represents an equation that contains only the variable . Once we have this value, we can use it in since it now has entries representing and and inserting our value for leaves just . Finally, we then use the values we have obtained for and in the first row to get our value for .  From this version of the augmented matrix, we can see that and so . As a result, we can see that and so . Using the first row with these values gives us . This results in .  The fact that our matrix has zeros in the lower left that enable us to easily back-solve means that this kind of matrix is special and thus deserves a special name. We refer to this structure of a matrix as upper triangular since the nonzero values of the coefficient matrix portion of the augmented matrix form a triangle.  If we want, we could make our back-solving easier by scaling the last two rows. If we multiply both the second and third rows by , we get     Here the command first takes the scalar, followed by the matrix and then the row that is being scaled.          From this version of the augmented matrix, we can more easily see that . As a result, we can see that and so . Using the first row with these values gives us . This results in .  You may notice that we can continue to use these manipulation processes to further reduce this matrix so that the \"back-solve\" process will be even easier. For example, wouldn't it be great if we could get the matrix into the form where we can easily read off the solutions since each row has a 1 in the position of a different variable and zeros everywhere else (i.e. no other substitutions to make)? We will address this later in this section.     Consider the following system of equations.     Convert the system of equations into an augmented matrix.    Use Gaussian Elimination to reduce your augmented matrix to one that is in upper triangular form. Be sure to indicate your process at each stage by using notation such as or . Feel free to use technology (e.g. command) to perform the arithmetic, but make sure to show your stages in the reduction process.    After you have solved for one of the values of the unknowns, back-solve to find the remaining unknown values.     Now that we have converted a system of equations to augmented matrix form and then used the process of Gaussian elimination to reduce the system and find solutions, we might ask the question, will we always be able to reduce the matrix to a nice upper triangular form where back-solving to obtain a unique solution is possible? As you will recall, not all linear combinations of vectors (and thus systems) end with a unique solution. This means that it will not always be able to find a unique solution to a given system of equations and thus get a nice upper triangular matrix. If you have taken a formal linear algebra course, you may recall that we can use the form of a matrix for linear systems to determine whether or not the solution(s) is (are) unique, infinite, or non-existent by simplying looking at a reduced version of the matrix.

To motivate the topics, he has created a project where students are working for a company that sells products to other companies and must manage the relationship between the price they charge for their products and the revenue they can generate from sales. He begins class by posing the task.   Jason : Today we are going to deal with a problem that many businesses face. How do you set prices for your products and what effects do those decisions have on the revenue you get from your consumers? Suppose we have a company that sells T-shirts to three main stores: Total Tees , T-Riffic , and T-Rex . Our company mass produces four basic prints of T-shirts. Let's call them T1 , T2 , T3 , and T4 . On the board, I have put the orders for each type of T-shirt for each of the three stores.    Jason's List of T-Shirt Orders   Jason's List of T-Shirt Orders     We want to be able to work with various options of pricing for the different shirts as the demand warrants. For example, if one particular print gaiin popularity, we might want to raise its cost to the stores since there is higher demand. If another print is less popular, we may want to lower the price we charge the stores to encourage more demand. Long-story-short, we want to develop a way to calculate the revenue we get from each store as we tweak the prices we charge for the different shirts. Does anyone have any questions? Yeah, Bri?   Bri : So what you're saying is that if we have the prices, we want to be able to quickly find the total amount we get from each store? With the orders you put on the board?   Jason : Yep. You got it!   Nic : What if the orders change?   Jason : Excellent question! Let's just assume the orders stay the same here and we are just messing with the prices for now. Make a note, though, Nic, and we'll come back to your idea later.   Rosa : Can we have some prices to start? I'd like to have some prices so I can do some calculations to see what's happening.   Jason : OK, how about saying that we charge $12 for T1, $9 for T2, $10 for T3, and $8 for T4. Will that work?   Rosa : Thanks. That'll give us somewhere to start.   Jason : Great, now go ahead in your groups and talk about how you might go about this. Feel free to use any tools we usually have in class like your computer or CAS.  [ Jason allows the students about 20 minutes to start talking about ways to handle the situation. As he circulates, Jason notices Mia's group working with their CAS to take a functional approach to deal with problem. He makes a note to have Mia share when the class comes back together for discussion. Jason also notes that Nic's group seems to holding onto Nic's earlier comment about changing orders and have started to explore the problem with a spreadsheet. Jason was happy to see Nic's group's approach as he thinks it will help him transition eventually to defining multiplication between a matrix and a vector. After time for exploration, Jason brings the class back together to share ideas. ]   Jason : So what did you try? Anyone want to go first? Yeah, Mia?   Mia : Well, we kinda used our CAS to define functions for each store. We can put the in the functions and it gives us the money we get froom them.   Jason : The revenue?   Mia : Yeah, I guess.   Jason : Can I show your calculator on the display?   Mia : Yeah, I'm logged in.  [ Jason displays Mia's calculator through the wireless network. (see )]    Mia's Group's Defined Functions   Mia's Group's Defined Functions      Jason : Tell us what everything is.   Mia : Well, the tt is for orders for Totally Tees, tr is for T-Riffic, and tx is for T-Rex. We just used w,x,y, and z for the placeholders for the prices so we can just enter them in the functions.   Jason : Great idea. Can you show us how you would calculate the revenue.   Mia : Sure, just put in 12, 9, 10, and 8 in the functions and you get ...    Mia's Group's Defined Functions   Mia's Group's Functions with Prices      Jason : That's a neat way to do it so you don't have to keep doing the same thing on your calculator and retyping the orders. With my luck, I'd retype something wrong anyway.   Vero : We kinda did something like that, but when our group was talking, Nic was sharing more about what he said earlier and we came up with something that lets us change more than the prices.   Jason : Can you share it? Can I put your calculator on the display?   Vero : I didn't do it on the calculator, but we used our Chromebooks. Can I plug it in?   Jason : Sure, bring it up.

He can't believe his luck that Vero's group formatted the spreadsheet the way they did with the prices listed vertically. As he looks at the command line for formatting the computation, the colored entries match his plans for later in the lesson. ]    In your groups, discuss your thoughts on the two approaches. How are they the same? How are they different? Summarize your thoughts on your whiteboards.    If you were in Jason's position, how would you link the approaches of Mia's and Vero's groups? What would you do next to make the connection? What common mathematical concept(s) are being used here?    In the episode, Jason begins to smile as he sees the method that Vero's group used. Why do you think he was smiling? Where will he take the lesson next? How does Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno's model apply here and how is it \"playing into Jason's hand\"?    In looking at Vero's spreadsheet, discuss in your groups how a spreadsheet might be a useful tool with young learners (elementary school) to introduce the concept of variable.   "

  "title": "What Is Algebra?",
  "body": " What Is Algebra?   In the preparation of secondary mathematics teachers, it is important to situate the content of algebra within the overall mathematical education of the learner. Where does algebra begin? For quite a few years, there has been a call for “algebra for all” in the eighth grade (Usiskin, 1987). The Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM, 2000) and the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSS-M) (NGACBP & CCSSO, 2010) have an algebra strand that runs through the spectrum of the curriculum from pre-Kindergarten through grade 12. The traditional place for algebra has been at the beginning of secondary school (usually at the ninth grade) for most students. Why then, does NCTM, CCSS, and others place algebra as a strand beginning in preschool education? Here we will address two major reasons that “algebra” is now being considered at lower grades: (1) our understanding about what constitutes algebra has significantly changed over the last few decades and (2) the advent of newer technologies has provided the opportunity for students to begin abstracting ideas at younger ages.    Algebraic Reasoning   Within the traditional culture algebra has been viewed as the collection of symbol manipulations and rules that govern them. This can be seen by the remarks given by the student in the TIMSS excerpt shared at the opening of this module. Here the student states, “It's kind of a set in stone. It's procedure. It's a formula. You learn the formula and you know how to do math.” This view of algebra as a collection of letters on a page has often stood in the way of exposing younger students to algebraic ideas because the feeling was that in order for students to do algebra, they must be able to use letters to represent mathematical ideas. Recent research; however, has suggested that younger students might be capable of symbolizing mathematical ideas (Carraher, Schielmann, Brizuela, & Earnest, 2006). But even if a student does not currently symbolize mathematical ideas in the traditional “algebraic” sense, does that mean they are not doing algebra? The basic assumption of the CCSS-M and NCTM Standards is that algebraic ideas develop over time and that the ability to directly symbolize is neither necessary nor sufficient to learn algebra. As you recall from our discussion of the Pirie and Kieren model for growth of mathematical understanding, the development of the concepts of algebra take place on various levels and evolve as the learner participates in experiences that advance the growth. The student may still be doing algebra even though they are not directly manipulating symbols.  To illustrate a young learner “doing” algebra, consider the following example from parenting experience. When my son was in first grade, I had taken him and his sisters to a local fast food establishment. At this particular restaurant, there was a children's area equipped with the standard network of “gerbil tubes” for the children to climb through as they frequently took breaks from eating. Now my son became tired of climbing around and sat down next to me at the table to see what I was doing. I had been playing with my TI-89 calculator equipped with a computer algebra system (CAS) and he asked me to show him what it would do. I knew that in his classroom he was studying inequality and so I asked if he wanted to play a game. Being bored, he quickly said yes and so I explained the rules to a game I called, “Guess My Number”. The game is quite simple (as the name suggests) and so I told him that I would store a number in the calculator and his job was to guess it by using only expressions of inequalities. I stored a number in the variable as shown in and then cleared the screen. My son then tried to guess the number by entering an inequality and reading the response. He then proceeded to try other inequalities until he thought he could guess the number. He thought this was a fun game and so I stored another number in and we started again. My son was fascinated with the idea that I could change and play again. Now this may not seem like algebra, but this simple activity was building the concept of variable in a first grader. It should also be noted that in this simple game, the three main views of variable ( unknown quantity , generalized quantity , and quantities in a functional relationship ) are all present. This type of algebraic reasoning is mathematics. The recognition of algebraic reasoning as a significant part of algebra has prompted us to better characterize what younger students do in mathematics and consider algebra a preK-12 endeavor.    Guess My Number Game   guess my number game      Technology and Abstraction   Due to the traditional perspective of algebra, we have been hesitant to challenge students to abstraction before we feel they are ready. Piaget's work has suggested that we need to be mindful of the developmental stage of our students and that younger students may not be physiologically capable of doing certain abstract tasks. Although we must acknowledge the limitations that students possess within their developmental progress toward abstraction, we must also seek experiences that will help them reach higher levels of abstraction. As in the Pirie and Kieren (1994) model, the continual advancing and folding back to expand understanding is part of the process that helps move students along. Technology is one mechanism that can assist students in the ability to abstract mathematical concepts.  Much like the example given above where a young child plays the game, “Guess My Number”, a computer algebra system (CAS) can play an important role in developing abstract representations. One might suggest that one of the most powerful pedagogical tools available in a CAS is the Define command. This command allows the student to name a mathematical expression and then act on it by its name as if it was an object. Arnon et al. (2014) use this construct in their APOS Theory. APOS Theory refers to viewing mathematical development through a four-stage structure. APOS refers to Action-Process-Object-Schema where the learner transistions through these stages much like Piaget's stages. The learner first does some action to interact with the mathematical idea. This leads to viewing it as a process that is eventually treated as an object. Once it is viewed as an object, it can be acted on and placed into a broader structure or schema. While the Define command may seem a trivial function of a CAS, it is an important feature in representing mathematical ideas in a way that they can be acted upon and thus the learner can begin placing a mathematical idea(s) into a coherent system. Kaput, Blanton and Moreno (2008) suggest that it is the student's interaction with notation that builds meaning of the notation. As in the “Guess My Number” game, students must choose the notation (i.e. , , ) and then observe the results of those choices. By this trial and error experience, meaning is developed in a much deeper way than simply listening to a teacher tell them what each symbol represents. We can all be told a definition, but it is not until we must use the definition that we obtain a gut-level understanding of its meaning. No one can do this for us. We must do it ourselves.  There is evidence to suggest that children at age 9 and 10 have the ability to represent mathematical concepts and relationships using algebraic notation (Carraher, Schliemann, Brizuela, & Earnest, 2006). Brizuela and Schliemann (2004) found that students in this age range could not only represent mathematical ideas algebraically, but could also use this notation to solve problems within an algebraic environment. This does not mean that we simply start using symbolic notation with young children. The students in the studies mentioned were first exposed to activities that helped them develop the ability to work on a more abstract level.  To illustrate how the concept of variable might be developed in young children we have previously shared the “Guess My Number” game. There are; however, other experiences that, over time, help to slowly expose the student to algebraic representation. In the elementary grades, students are required by most school districts to learn basic word processing and spreadsheet functionality. The use of a spreadsheet can help the student construct a concept image (Tall & Vinner, 1981) of variable by simply formatting one cell in relation to another. Consider the following problem posed to a group of fourth graders ( ).    You've Got Mail Activity   You've Got Mail Activity     In response to the problem, some students began by using a spreadsheet and formating it to fit the table. A sample of the students' approach can be seen in .    Sample Spreadsheet Created by Fourth Graders   Sample Spreadsheet     In this instance the student clicks on the cells they wish to use in the calculation of the postage (A2 and B2). Those cell names are then expressed in the command line and the postage calculation is given by “=A2*0.03+B2*0.05”. As simple as this exercise may seem, even young children are capable of understanding what the spreadsheet is doing. The students are beginning to represent “changeable” quantities by expressions like A2 and B2. Later in this exploration, the students used the “Fill Down” command to copy the expression relative to the corresponding cells in columns and in other rows so that they could continue to test various combinations of 3¢ and 5¢ stamps. Here they were not only using the fact that the expressions in column were “changeable”, but that the values in columns and were as well. The experience that cell values can be changed and that those changes affect the postage calculation helps lay the groundwork for the concept of variable which we will discuss further in the next section.  Here we have tried to describe how technology can be used to help advance algebraic reasoning and concept development at a young age. What about secondary school students? Throughout this course we have used similar strategies tied to technology such as computer algebra systems, dynamic geometry systems, and data collection devices to give you experience implementing these approaches in both your own learning of mathematics as well as your reflection on pedagogical uses in the secondary classroom. We live in a technological world and so to think we can teach meaningful mathematics that is relevant to today's society without the use of technology is simply misguided and certainly not supported by the decades of research on the use of technology in the teaching and learning of mathematics.  So what exactly is algebra? Some view it as an extension of arithmetic (a generalized arithmetic or number if you will). However, Davydov (1999) showed that students could actually develop algebraic structure through relationships between quantities instead. The students that Davydov worked with and the subsequent curriculum developed has been successful in allowing younger children to develop both the structural view of algebra while symbolizing these structural relationships. Schmittau and Morris (2004) used Davydov's curriculum with elementary children in the US and found that by the end, the children could use their understanding to solve algebraic problem typically reserved for secondary school students in the US.  Algebra is more than simply moving symbols around a page. The algebraic reasoning that allows the learner to understand why certain processes work is just as important (if not more) as the ability to perform the symbolic manipulations. The research on use of computer algebra systems clearly shows that CAS can actually be used to help develop by-hand skills and conceptual understanding. In a technological world, the emphasis that used to be placed on by-hand skills needs to be reduced since many of those skills are not as important as they used to be. For instance, it was not that long ago that the curriculum required students to be able to compute to four decimal places by hand. Today, we would look at that part of the curriculum and ask why? Every calcultor has a square root button, so is there a need for proficiency at doing this computation? It is far more important that a student understand that if we multiply that 1.73205ish number by itself, we get 3. That is the concept of square root. Ability to compute it by hand is simply not necessary and so this is why the curriculum stopped requiring it. In the same sense, future generations will ask why we spent so much time making sure students could proficiently do much of the symbolic manipulation we currently require when CAS was available to allow students to focus on thinking rather than symbol pushing.  In addition to the use of CAS for exploring patterns, meaning of symbolic manipulations can come from the use of other resources such as manipulatives. Recall that back in , we used an area model to examine how we multiply fractions. Similarly, we can also use physical models for exploring properties of symbolic expressions when we multiply them. The physical manipulatives we use for this purpose are called algebra tiles and they are just area (or sometimes volume) models that involve more than just numerical values, but also \"unknown\" amounts. In these tiles, there are objects that have lengths that are clearly not a whole number multiples of the other \"unit\" objects in the set. These are our \"unknown\" variables and so we can create area models that involve both variables and integers and combinations of them.    Algebra Tiles and Factoring Trinomials   Suppose you are teaching a high school Algebra 1 class and are tasked with teaching factoring trinomials into a product of two binomials? How might you start? Traditionally, the teacher would show many examples where they perform this process and then the students are given some trinomials to practice. The problem with this approach is that it is promoting mimicking and not thinking. So how might we change this instructional sequence to better promote thinking and reasoning so that the student discover the process we want them to do as opposed to purely memorize it?    Virtual Algebra Tiles       In front of you, you have a physical set of algebra tiles (or you can use the virtual ones above in ). Using the variable length tiles, \" \", along with unit tiles, try to form a rectangle with length, , on one side and length, , on the other side. On your whiteboards, draw a sketch of your area model labeling the tiles you used to fill in the rectangle. How many of each type of tile did you use to fill in the rectangle? What polynomial would the resulting rectangle represent and how are the numbers of each type of tile in your rectangle related to the coefficients of your polynomial?    Now consider the product, . Model this product in the same way as in part (a). On your whiteboards, draw a sketch of your area model labeling the tiles you used to fill in the rectangle. How many of each type of tile did you use to fill in the rectangle? What polynomial would the resulting rectangle represent and how are the numbers of each type of tile in your rectangle related to the coefficients of your polynomial?    Now let's turn this process around. Suppose we start with the result of . Take out one tile, seven tiles, and six units. Try to arrange these tiles into a rectangle. Draw a sketch of your rectangle on your whiteboards. Compare your sketch with that of other groups. Are they all the same? If not, what are the differences? What are the dimensions along each side of your rectangle and what product does this represent?    Now try the same approach from part (c) to break down . Try to arrange these tiles into a rectangle. Draw a sketch of your rectangle on your whiteboards. Compare your sketch with that of other groups. Are they all the same? If not, what are the differences? What are the dimensions along each side of your rectangle and what product does this represent?    In both parts (c) and (d), summarize any patterns you see in where the component tiles ended up. Pay particular attention to the location of the \" \" tiles and the units. How were they separated within the rectangle's interior and how is this separation related to the coefficients in the original polynomial?      highlights how we can help students develop an understanding of algebraic structure through the use of physical manipulatives. The processes and relationships among coefficients in the factored and expanded forms of these expressions go beyond the simple memorization of an acronym like FOIL. There is meaning behind where these tiles end up in the resulting rectangles and the distributive property is at the heart of this explanation. For many students, FOIL is considered a mathematical property, while a true property like the Distributive Property is forgotten. This is what we mean by bringing meaning to structure.  Seeing structure is at the heart of grasping algebraic concepts, but structure is often the part of the algebra curriculum we pay the least attention to when it comes to our instruction. Kaput (2008) states, \"The heart of algebraic reasoning is comprised of complex symbolization processes that serve purposeful generalizations and reasoning with generalizations\". Symbolization gives students the ability to organize ideas into smaller visual space as compared to use of prose. Beyond this, symbolization not only reasons with existing ideas, but also shapes new ideas as they develop. The symbols we use affect the way we see reality and so algebra encompasses far more than the symbols used, but serve as a medium by which we reason. One of the most powerful aspects of mathematics is its symbolization; however, one of the biggest obstacles of mathematics (from a learner standpoint) is it symbolization. Students must be able to unpack the symbols when using them to reason. As Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno suggest, this happens when students are given time to interact with the symbols (or even better, are allowed to create the symbols). Just like learning a language, we begin with translation between words until those words become so connected in our mental schema that we can use them interchangeably. As this process progresses, we move toward fluency. The same is true for mathematical language. Students must be given the time to move back and forth between the represented world and the world of symbols doing the representing.

In planning his lesson, he is trying to create trinomials that will engage his students to discover the patterns between the coefficients in the trinomials and the coefficients found in their factored binomials.

  "title": "Developing the Concept of Variable",
  "body": " Developing the Concept of Variable   If you were to ask the typical person on the street to describe algebra, more than likely their first response would have something to do with “letters” or variables. The concept of variable is central to the study of algebra. Historically, the ability of mathematicians to use a symbol or collection of symbols to represent quantities was a major breakthrough that allowed complex mathematical ideas to be expressed in writing within a much smaller space. Prior to this, it might have taken several pages of prose to express a mathematical statement, theorem, or proof. With the use of variables, the same idea could be communicated in a single page or less within a single field of view. This allowed the reader to follow an argument or train of thought without flipping back and forth among many pages of text. While this may seem like a simple idea, it had major consequences on the development of mathematics.  Although the use of variables proved to be an important advancement, it came with a price. To illustrate this price, think back to your first experience with function notation. It is not uncommon for a student to look at the collection of symbols, , and interpret it to mean “multiply f by x”. In mathematics, we often use similar symbol structures to communicate different meanings. In the example just given, the student often generalizes notation encountered earlier and applies that meaning to a new situation. This is consistent with Pirie and Kieren's (1994) construct of folding back as it is applied to a symbol system. When a student misinterprets function notation to mean multiplication, it likely comes from their earlier experiences with multiplying integers such as . Typically parentheses are used in this case when negative integers are introduced so that the operation of subtraction is not confused with the negative sign attached to the integer. Hence the power of symbol use carries with it the problem of “unpacking” the symbols to grasp their meaning.    Three Views of Letter Use (Trigueros & Ursini, 2003)  As we begin to examine the concept of variable, we will first restrict our discussion to the literature surrounding the use of “letters” as a form of representation. Using letters is probably the most common vantage point regarding the concept of variable for most people. In fact, one could argue that a thumbnail definition of variable for most secondary school students could be characterized by “the advanced study of the last three letters of the alphabet”. For this reason, we first turn our attention to the use of letters to represent variables. Within this context, Trigueros and Ursini (2003) propose three structural categories: unknown number , generalized number , and functional relationship .   Unknown Number   Since one of the most useful applications of algebra is the solution of equations, it should come as no surprise that variable as an unknown number is one way to view the concept of variable. A variable may be thought of as an unknown number when we are faced with a statement like where there are specific value(s) that the variable can take. Recall from our example in the “Guess My Number” game (see ) played on computer algebra system. In this game, the concept of variable as an unknown number is one way to look at the use of the letter, . In this case, one player has stored a specific value in the calculator's memory and linked it to the letter. The second player must then attempt discover the hidden value. Here, there is a single value being used and thus the letter, , represents an unknown number.   Generalized Number   Although the “Guess My Number” game can be viewed as using the concept of variable as an unknown number, the continuation of play within the game illustrates our next perspective for interpreting variable. Recall that the game is quite simple. One player stores a number in the calculator as a letter and the opponent's job is to guess it by using only expressions of inequalities or other expressions using the letter. As play continues in the game, the players repeatedly change the “unknown number” in order to challenge their opponent. It is this “changing of the unknown” that illustrates our second view of variable as a generalized number . In the instance of a generalized number, the variable may have a less specific referent as compared to the unknown number. In mathematics, we often use a variable to express a generalized number while simultaneously allowing the possibility that it can also stand for an unknown number within a specific context. For example, consider in the expression . As we use this expression in a general sense to represent an odd integer, the symbol, , is a generalized number generating a set of various odd integers. However, when we decide to place a restriction on the same expression where we state that , now represents an unknown number rather than a generalized number. So when we ask what represents in the expression , the answer is that it all depends on the question we are asking.  As we develop notation, we often need a way to distinguish the difference between a generalized number and a specific number. You may recall from your study of Calculus, that mathematicians often do this by using to represent the generalized derivative of a function and the notation to represent the derivative at a specific point, . Although the format of the symbols is the same, there is an implied difference that only a person enculturated into the mathematical community would necessarily see.   Variables in a Functional Relationship   The third view of variable given by Trigueros and Ursini is that of variables in a functional relationship. Although this might seem similar to the view of generalized number stated earlier in the form of , this conceptualization is different. Here, Trigueros and Ursini refer to a specific relationship such as Hook's Law, . In this case, there is an implied variation involved between two variables where the nature of the variation itself is of interest.  Whenever we consider a graph generated by an equation such as , we are witnessing variables in a functional relationship . We can ask questions such as, how does change in one variable affect change in another? How fast is one variable changing with respect to the other? What happens to as gets very large in the positive direction? Compared to the view of variable as a generalized number where an expression like simply stands for an arbitrary odd integer, the view of variables in a functional relationship carries with it a context aimed at describing relationships.   Merging Views of Variable   As we consider the ways in which students use the concept of variable (in this case the use of letters or symbols to represent variables) we may be concerned with which view should come first or which view is the most important. However, we would like to propose that these questions are of lesser concern. If we are interested in helping students build a deeper conceptualization of variable, we must ask ourselves how do students connect all of these views? We posit that the issue on conceptual connection is far more important than which view should come first, although we acknowledge that the concern of order might impact the question of connection. Our argument is that in order for students to develop a concept of variable, they must be able to merge these views of variable and be ably to flexibly move among them. In addition, not only do students need to be able to move among varying views of variable, they must also be able to navigate back and forth between symbols and meaning (Sfard, 2000). Therefore, the question then becomes, how do we develop curricula that encourage students to move back and forth among various views of variable across multiple representations? In this section, we have focused on the symbolic representation of variable, but we will spend more time looking at other representations in a section devoted specifically to this issue.   Tools for Merging Views of Variable   As far as the symbolic representation is concerned, one resource we have to help students merge various views of the concept of variable is the use of computer algebra systems (CAS). In order to discuss this issue and the use of a technical tool such as CAS we feel it necessary to first disclose the theoretical perspective that we use to approach the development of conceptual understanding. While scholars debate the merits and drawbacks of various theoretical perspectives ranging from radical constructivism to socio-cultural paradigms, we consider ourselves to be social constructivists. What this means is that we believe students develop mathematical understanding from both internal and external influences. Cognitive conflict from within a learner is a powerful mechanism for conceptual change, but the influence of the mathematical community is also a powerful tool. So why do we worry about our theoretical perspective here? Well, the use of CAS carries with it an implied pre-ordained structure set forth by the mathematical community. In order for a student to use a CAS, there is certain syntax and structure that must be followed. In this case, the more open view of radical constructivism as a theory of concept development become problematic while within the social constructivist view students may first develop notation, but later be forced to conform to the community's notation needed to use CAS as a tool for exploration. In addition, there may be times where the teacher must introduce notation even before the meaning has been explored. Is this a concern? We tend to side with Sfard's (2000) perspective when she states:    [I]nstead of asking “What comes first?” we would rather give thought to the question of how to orchestrate and facilitate the back-and-forth movement between symbols and meaning. This seems to be the only way to cope with the problem of circularity that is inherent in discourse that creates its own objects. (p. 92)    The issue of the symbiotic relationship between notation and concept is important. Often in mathematics, notation drives concept development in a way similar to the reverse relationship where the concept drives the notation. To think that there is a single approach appropriate to all situations, limits creativity and produces a very narrow view to teaching and learning. We would rather let the classroom context guide the order of this relationship. It is often the translation among notation systems that helps deepen the concept and therefore as Sfard posits, we seek more to aid in the translation.  In order to illustrate this notational translation and the deepening of concepts, consider the use of a CAS to work with sequences and series. In standard mathematical notation, we often refer to a sequence or series with notation such as and . The problem is that in order to explore these mathematical objects using CAS we must first translate these into computer or “calculator speak”. The use of function notation helps us to deal with subscripts and variables within one symbol system while encouraging students to focus attention on a dual variation happening within a single expression. For example, in the sequence we have two quantities that can “vary”—the term index and the input variable. In translating this to a useful language in a CAS, we define . The use of a function of two variables serves us in three ways. The first is the ability to quickly evaluate a specific term of the sequence using a simple input such as to represent the evaluation of the 13th term using . This encourages the student to create an object and then operate on it in a very abstract way. The second benefit we gain is the cognitive conflict that is generated by the notational use. As stated earlier, when students are introduced to function notation, they often confuse the use of parentheses to separate the function name from the input variable with the operation of multiplication between integers. The fact that a comma is being used within the parentheses causes the student to pause and re-evaluate his\/her understanding of the notation. A byproduct of this re-evaluation is that the student may realize that there are two quantities that can vary within the expression.  The third benefit we gain from the use of CAS is the ability of the student to move from an understanding of the expression as a process to that of an object. This goes beyond the simple evaluation of the sequence and allows the student to explore general behavior. For example, if we wish to explore the convergence of the series , we can combine previously defined objects to create another sequence describing the partial sum. In this case we might define . Here the students are encouraged to make sense of the parts of the definition in order to understand the meaning. It is important to note that the design of the curricula utilizing this approach is crucial so that students will simply try to memorize procedures. Deliberate questions must be present to guide the students to make the connections among notation systems and meaning.  The moral of this story is that technology can serve as a powerful tool for merging different views of variable. The challenge is that the classroom environment must transform to allow discourse so that students feel comfortable with both processes of creation and translation of notation. The teacher must be cognizant of the interplay among the processes involved in this dynamic in order to successfully orchestrate the classroom to allow the formation of algebraic concepts with the depth we desire.

Think back to your early experiences with algebra in middle or high school. What would you say was its purpose? You will likely recall spending a great deal of time solving equations. In fact, much of the processes and procedures that you spent substantial time mastering were in pursuit of solutions to equations. But how and why do these processes and procedures work? To answer this question, we need to examine the \"structure\" that is algebra.      Suppose you wanted to solve the equation, . What processes would you use to solve it? For each of the following stages of the solution process, provide a mathematical property that was used to transform the equation to its new form.         Choose from:  Associative Property of Addition  Additive Identity  Additive Inverse  Addition Property of Equality  Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition  Zero Property of Multiplication         Choose from:  Associative Property of Addition  Additive Identity  Additive Inverse  Addition Property of Equality  Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition  Zero Property of Multiplication         Choose from:  Associative Property of Addition  Additive Identity  Additive Inverse  Addition Property of Equality  Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition  Zero Property of Multiplication         Choose from:  Associative Property of Addition  Additive Identity  Additive Inverse  Addition Property of Equality  Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition  Zero Property of Multiplication    Could you use your process if the only set of numbers allowed was the set of integers, ?    Could you use your process if the only set of numbers allowed was the set of real numbers, ?     In , you identified mathematical properties at each stage of the solution process. But is there truly a \"structure\" to this process? If so, can this structure be abstracted and can it be used in other cases for solving equations? Consider the following activity.     Suppose you wanted to solve the equation, . What processes would you use to solve it? For each of the following stages of the solution process, provide a mathematical property that was used to transform the equation to its new form.          Choose from:  Associative Property of Multiplication  Multiplicative Identity  Multiplicative Inverse  Multiplicative Property of Equality  Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition  Zero Property of Multiplication         Choose from:  Associative Property of Multiplication  Multiplicative Identity  Multiplicative Inverse  Multiplicative Property of Equality  Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition  Zero Property of Multiplication         Choose from:  Associative Property of Multiplication  Multiplicative Identity  Multiplicative Inverse  Multiplicative Property of Equality  Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition  Zero Property of Multiplication         Choose from:  Associative Property of Multiplication  Multiplicative Identity  Multiplicative Inverse  Multiplicative Property of Equality  Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition  Zero Property of Multiplication    Could you use your process if the only set of numbers allowed was the set of integers, ?    Could you use your process if the only set of numbers allowed was the set of real numbers, ?    Looking at the mathematical properties you used in , describe any pattern you see with respect to parts (a)-(d) of this activity.    In , you used addition as the operation within the equation. In this activity, you used multiplication. Suppose you have an equation that uses only one operation, summarize the basic properties that are essential in order to solve an equation.     The properties that you just noticed in trying to solve the equations in and are the basic and essential properties that are required to solve an equation that uses only one binary operation. For this reason, it should come as no surprise that the most basic structure we define in algebra is composed of these properties. We call a structure that has these four properties a group and we will spend some time looking at the behavior of groups and examine how these structures are actually taught in the secondary algebra curriculum.     A group is a set, along with a binary operation, , such that if the following properties hold.   Closure : If , then .   Associativity : If , then .   Identity : There exists an element, , (called the identity ) such that for all .   Inverses : For all , there exists an inverse element , denoted , such that .     Think back to when you first decided to become a secondary mathematics teacher. Now recall your reaction when you learned how much mathematics you had to take to complete the degree. Often preservice mathematics teachers contemplate entering the profession thinking, “Well, I've been through high school math so becoming a math teacher shouldn't be too difficult. After all, it only involves learning how to present the mathematics I already know.”  When listening to university students talking in the hallways, it is not uncommon to hear comments such as, “Why do I have to take Abstract Algebra, I'm never going to teach this stuff to high school students?” Lurking in the background is the assumption that they have a deep knowledge of the mathematics that makes up the secondary curriculum. Unfortunately, most high school students' perception of algebra involves symbol manipulations and memorized formulae and algorithms. In order to address the underlying structure of mathematics, we will examine a basic skill that is taught in the secondary schools from an advanced standpoint.   The Concept of Inverse: Setting the Stage  In order to begin a fruitful discussion of mathematical concepts and their relationship to teaching and learning, it is helpful to first examine our own understanding of the concepts in question. In this particular section, we will investigate the concept of inverse function. From a constructivist perspective, no two people have exactly the same conceptual understanding of inverse function. While there may be some common definitions and representations used for describing this idea, not all people have the same mental constructs and images that emerge when the term “inverse function” is mentioned. The way in which other mathematical ideas are connected to this concept may also be quite different depending on the person you ask. Here you will be asked to give some preliminary responses to questions and to build a concept map showing your linkages among mathematical ideas.     We begin by reflecting on our own understanding of inverse. In your own words, respond to the following questions with respect to your current conception of \"inverse function\".    In relation to the concept of function, describe what the term “inverse function” means?    Describe how you came to understand the concept of inverse function.    Imagine yourself in your first teaching position where you have to teach students about inverse functions, how would you teach it? How is it connected to other mathematics they have learned (i.e. what would Pirie & Kieren give as the primitive knowing for expanding the concept of inverse function)?     One of the ways in which we advance our thinking is through reflection. In , you began by describing your understanding of a concept. At this point it is important to reflect on your responses and try to articulate your understanding in greater detail. To accomplish this task, we will use a concept map to pull your mental constructs together and prompt you to reflect on your own understanding.     A concept map is like a flow chart; however, there is not necessarily a linear flow of ideas. Instead, it is often the case that the concept map resembles more of a web with concepts connected in a variety of ways. gives a sample of a concept map constructed by a student showing relationships within concepts from a Linear Algebra course. The main aspects of the maps are the concept (usually encased in a bubble) and segments or directed line segments showing how the concepts are connected. In some cases, the connections are bidirectional; in others they may only go one way. These connections usually have words or symbols written along them to explain how the person views the connection between the two concepts.    Sample Concept Map for Linear Algebra   Sample Concept Map       Using all related concepts you can think of, create a concept map for the concept of inverse function .    Share your concept map with other members of your group. On your whiteboards, summarize commonalities in your group members' maps. Summarize some of the ways in which group members gave a unique connection on their maps.     Now that you have started to reflect on the concept of inverse function, consider the following classroom exchange as a teacher (Tim) interacts with his students. Following the vignette, you will be asked to respond to questions surrounding the discussion.    Inverse Functions: The Case of Tim   Tim is a beginning teacher in his second year. Today, he is teaching the concept of inverse function. To find an inverse function, the text that Tim is using begins by having the students swap the variables of and and then solve for . He is fairly confident that he can teach his students how to use this procedure to find inverse functions, but also noted that the book has students check to see if the inverse function works by composing the two functions to see if the composition results in “x”. Tim also noticed that the book covers function composition in the section before inverse function and assumes this is so that students can understand how to check their answers once they have found the inverse function. Since he wants to be sure the students are ready, he begins class by discussing the previous day's lesson on function composition.   Tim : OK, let's make sure we understand what we did yesterday since we are going to use it today. What is composition of functions?   Jen : Isn't it just sticking one thing into another?   Tim : Yes, it is. Can anyone show us how to do it? [ Lori raises her hand ]. Lori, go to the board. Can anyone give us two functions? [ Ken raises his hand ]. Ken, whatcha got?   Ken : How about and ?   Tim : Great. Now Lori, show us what to do.   Lori : OK, I guess it depends on what order you want.   Tim : Let's do .   Lori : So we just take and stick it in for in . That gives us . Now we can just distribute it out and that gives us .   Tim : Super! Is everyone OK with that? [ The class is quiet ]. Good, let's move on to today's stuff. Thanks, Lori. [ Lori sits down ].   Tim : Today we're going to look at inverses when it comes to functions. Has anyone ever heard the word “inverse” before? [ Several hands go up ]. Yeah, Mia.   Mia : Wouldn't that just be like the flip of a function?   Tim : [ Smiles ]. No, that's a common mistake. This is completely different when it comes to functions. Let's look at the book's way of finding inverse functions. In pairs, take a couple of minutes to read the procedure on page 213 (see ).    Excerpt from Tim's Text   Tim's Text     [ Students are given 5 minutes to read and discuss the procedure as Tim circulates observing their discussions. Tim notices that in the pair of Mike and Sam, Mike seems to be doing most of the explaining and so plans to call on Mike. ]   Tim : Mike, in your own words explain how to find inverse functions.   Mike : Well, first you just switch the and s. Then you just solve for so that is on one side of the equation and the other side just has s.   Tim : Very good. Let's do one together. Let's start with lines. How about the function we used earlier, . Tell me what to do. Yeah, Joan, get us started.   Joan : First write it as .   Tim : Now what? Someone else [ Hiro raises his hand ]. Hiro go ahead.   Hiro : Just add 1 to both sides to get . The only thing we have to do now is divide by 3 so we get all by itself. That gives us .   Tim : Excellent. Does everyone see how it's done? [ Kat raises her hand ]. Yeah, Kat.   Kat : How do we know it's the inverse function?   Tim : I'm glad you asked that, Kat. That's our next part of the lesson. To see if it worked, we just think of these as functions and compose them like we did yesterday. If we get “x”, then they are inverses. Let's try it. OK, let's make like we did before and now make . Sue, come to the board and work out this composition.   Sue : [ Sue goes to the board and begins writing. ] OK, we have . That gives . We can cancel the 3s and that leaves just and . The 1 and -1 cancel and we get .   Tim : Great. Do you see, Kat? Since we got that means they're inverses.   Kat : I'm still not sure how you know they're inverses?   Tim : Well, we got . If you compose a function and its inverse you get . Let's do a few more and that might help with remembering it.   Kat : But why do we get ? Why don't we get 1?   Tim : That's just the definition of what it means to be an inverse function. Just follow these steps and you'll be OK.  [ Kat gives a frustrated look and pulls out another sheet of paper. ]    Describe the central issues involved in the classroom exchange.    At one point a student, Mia, offers up an explanation of what is meant by an inverse function. In response to this, Tim (the teacher) says, “No, that's a common mistake. This is completely different when it comes to functions. Let's look at the book's way of finding inverse functions. In pairs, take a couple of minutes to read the procedure on page 213.”. Discuss your thoughts on Tim's response.       Inverse and Algebraic Structure  Now that we have started to reflect on our own experiences with inverses, we need to spend a little time exploring inverses beyond the elementary operations of addition and multiplication. While these early experiences ground us in similar patterns of behavior of sets of numbers with each operation, we need to branch out to other sets of object and operations in order to begin to abstract these behaviors and not worry about the context in which they live. After all, Poincaré expressed this so well.     Mathematicians do not study objects, but relations among objects; they are indifferent to the replacement of objects by others as long as relations do not change. Matter is not important, only form interests them. — Henri Poincaré .    As we saw in Tim's class from , Kat was frustrated by the response she received from Tim when her expectation of obtaining a 1 when composing a function and its inverse did not occur. In addition to this, Mia tried to explain her understanding of inverse by stating, \"Wouldn't that just be like the flip of a function?\". To which Tim smiled and responded, \"No, that's a common mistake. This is completely different when it comes to functions.\" Instead of taking these two responses and noticing the commonality (both students seemed to be thinking of multiplication as the operation), Tim shut them down as if what they are about to learn with respect to inverse functions is a new concept. Pirie & Kieren would see the students' responses as an opportunity to fold back to more familiar sets and operations where the students have comfort and build toward abstraction by prompting the learner to explore the underlying structure inherent in the behavior common to addition, multiplication, and function composition. To help us frame our discussion, let's take a little mathematical detour and explore the same structure we noticed before we defined a group . Only this time, we will use sets of functions and our operation will be function composition , .    Form and Function   This activity explores basic concepts of algebra including properties of algebraic structure. In high school, the primary operations used in algebra were multiplication and addition. Are these the only types of operations that can be used? We will explore this question and look for patterns that are common across algebra.  Recall that in your experiences in elementary school, you first learned to operate on the set of integers, , using a simple operation, addition. When this set was combined with the operation of addition, certain properties held. Some of these properties included: closure , associativity , the existence of an identity element, and inverses .  Consider the set of functions, , where the functions are defined as follows:     Mathematics can be described as the study of patterns. For this reason, we often look for similar structure in both nature and mathematical systems. Mathematics can certainly be used to study patterns in the physical world, but we can also look for patterns within mathematics itself. Are there times when one mathematical system is, for all practical purposes, “identical” to another mathematical system and therefore governed by the same properties and relationships? If this is so, then one system can give us quite a bit of information about another system. In fact, if one system is easier to operate on, we can use it instead and then deduce information about the other system without having to do more difficult computations.  In this activity, we will explore what properties exist when pairing the set above with the operation of composition of functions, . As you explore this set, try to keep your eyes open for patterns in the relationships among functions. Some properties you may want to check might include: closure, associativity, identity, inverses, and commutativity. For example, consider your experience with basic arithmetic. For addition on the set of integers, the set is closed since adding two integers always results in another integer. The number 0 acts as an identity (i.e. , leaving other elements unchanged) and 5 and -5 are inverses of each other (i.e. , where combining them yields 0, the identity). This type of structure is very important for deducing mathematical truths within a mathematical system.  To begin, we define the functions above on your computer algebra system. This has already been done for you on page 1.1 of the TI-Nspire CAS document. Once the functions are defined, build an operation table (called a Cayley table) for the composition of functions of the form in the space below by simply entering compositions such as and recording the result in the table as shown. This can be done more efficiently by first entering the functions in a spreadsheet (see page 1.2 of the FormFunction.tns file) and naming the entire set of functions “funset” and then performing compositions on the entire set all at once either on the Calculator page or in the Lists & Spreadsheets page (see ). If you use the spreadsheet, note that the columns in the spreadsheet correspond to rows in the table you are filling in due to the way the same operation is performed for an entire column in the spreadsheet. This syntax is similar to Microsoft Excel [i.e. by typing ].    Composing Functions on the the Calculator and Lists & Spreadsheets apps          Operation Table      In general, is the set  closed under the operation of composition of functions? In other words, when performing the operation on any two elements of the set, do you always get a result that is also an element of the set? If not, what elements yield an element not in ?    Recall that the associative property states that for any three elements under the operation, say , . How might you check associativity? How many different permutations of these functions would you need to check to be certain of associativity? Devise a plan to check associativity. Your plan might include other groups from the class (divide and conquer is often very effective).    Is there a function from the set that acts like an identity element? If so, what is the function?    Does every element have an inverse? If so, list all elements and their inverses. If not, list all elements that do have an inverse along with their inverse element.    Recall if a set along with an operation meets the four criteria of closure, associativity, an identity element, and all elements have inverses, then we call the set a group . Does this set of six functions under the operation of function composition form a group?    In general, do the elements of the set commute with each other? In other words, do you always get the same result when combining any two given elements in either order ( commutativity )? If all of the elements of a group commute with each other, then the group is called abelian . If a group is abelian, what kind of symmetry would you see in its Cayley table?    If the group is not abelian , for each element of , find all elements of that do commute with it. In other words, find all elements of that commute with , then all elements of that commute with , then all elements of that commute with , …etc. Here you might want to use the Cayley table you created earlier along with your answer regarding the symmetry of the table for commutativity from part (f). We call each of these sets the centralizer of the element, denoted , , .    Now list all of the elements that the sets you found in part (g) have in common. In other words, find . Since each of these elements must commute with each and every element of in order to be in the intersection, we call this special set of elements that commute with each other the center of  and denote it by .  If a group would be abelian , what elements would be in its center?    On the Calculator page (page 2.1) of your CAS, if , find if it is defined by . Note that a “power” here is not the usual “repeated multiplication”, but instead repeated composition of functions.    On page 2.2, use your algebraic spreadsheet to generate a sequence of . To do this, you can use the feature of the spreadsheet by first entering in the cell and then in cell entering . Then select cell and choose menu  followed by . Using the down arrow key, move down in the spreadsheet about 8 cells or so and press enter · (See screens below for setting up the recursive composition). For what powers of do you get ? Note that we labeled the column “kord” because this iteration will help us find what is called the order of the element .                  Using your algebraic spreadsheet to make a column for each function, repeat part (j) for the other functions in . Label the columns “ford”, “gord”, “hord”, …etc. List the elements in each set produced. For example, in using the element , you should get . You should notice that these elements just keep repeating and so the set is just limited to these three elements (note that when listing elements, we do not care about the order in which the elements are listed since they are just a set). Mathematically here we use the notation to mean the subgroup generated by  (i.e. repeatedly iterating with itself ). In this case, is finite with order 3 since it begins to repeat. What can you say about the sizes of these subsets? Here the \"size\" or number of elements in the subgroup is called the order of the subgroup. State any patterns you notice.                      List the smallest positive “power” for each element of that yields, [this is called the order of the element , denoted . You can also think of this as the number of elements in the subsets produced in part (k)]. State any relationship you see between these powers and the number of elements in set, .                      Do any of the subsets found in part (k) form a group? If so, we call them subgroups because they are a subset that is also a group? Groups or subgroups that have this repeating pattern when generated by a single element are called cyclic . List all of the subgroups you find. Explain how you know each is a group.    Subgroup   Let be a subset of elements from a group, . If the subset under the same operation used for forms a group, we call a subgroup , denoted .       Cyclic Groups and Subgroups   Let be an element of a finite group, . We can generate a subgroup, , of by taking an element and forming where we exhaust the powers of until we get the identity and it thus repeats. This subgroup, , is called a cyclic subgroup . We call the generator of the subgroup and denote . If , we say that is a cyclic group .     What do you think would happen if we composed a function not found in a specific subgroup with each element in that subgroup? To investigate this question, pick one of the subgroups generated in a column from part (k) and compose it with a function not in the subgroup. For example, using the subgroup and composing the elements with, say , we get the new set as shown below. This subset formed by composing with is denoted and called a coset . This can be done in either the Calculator page or the dynamic Notes page as shown below. Note that for your convenience, the Notes page (3.3) allows you to edit the subgroup at the top of the page and all cosets below it are automatically updated.    Coset   Let be a subgroup of a group . Let be any fixed element of . Then the set of all products of the form where is called a left coset for of in and is denoted by . Similarly, is called a right coset of in .             How many elements are in our new coset, ? Does the new coset form a subgroup? Use the Notes page (3.3) for composing the elements of with the other elements from not in . What do you notice? Describe what you observe if the other element is already in (e.g. compose with all elements from . Explain why your observations would be true.    Consider the following diagram of the set, . Draw a boundary around the cosets you found in part (n). An example of the boundary for the coset of the function composed with the subgroup is shown below. Describe what you notice about the coset boundaries you draw for each situation you found in part (n). Sketch a boundary around the resulting elements in below.    coset diagram 1      Now repeat what you did in parts (m) & (n) using each different subgroup you found in part (k), sketching boundaries around the cosets formed in the composition of all of the elements from with the subgroup. What can you say about the relationship among the cosets formed in each case?    coset diagram 1      Do all of the different cosets you found in part (p) form subgroups? If not, under what conditions do they form subgroups?    At this point our observations about the partitioning of a group into subsets is based solely on one example of a group. To test your conjectures, first confirm that the following set, , of matrices forms a group under the operation of regular matrix multiplication. To do this, first insert a new problem by pressing doc and selecting and then . After selecting a Calculator page, use the Define command to store each matrix by name in memory so that product of, say and , can be entered simply as on the CAS. Now create subgroups of the set by raising each element to increasing powers until you reach the identity, then repeat the process from parts (o) and (p) to see if the group of matrices is partitioned in a similar manner as was the set by sketching and circling subsets.       coset diagram 1      Using the evidence from your diagrams, give an argument for why the order of an element must divide the order of the group. Given that your argument is based on only a few cases of evidence (namely the sets and with various subgroups), what main properties would you need to show in order to prove your claim in general?     So what are the takeaways from this investigation, specifically for this particular set and operation, as well as for general structures that have the properties of groups? Well, let's consider the observations you hopefully noticed in the exploration. We can summarize four main ideas here.     From part (k), the order (or size) of the subgroups were either 1, 2, or 3.    From part (n), all cosets were the same size as the subroup that generated the coset.    From part (p), cosets generated by a given subgroup are either completely identical or completely disjoint.    From part (p), all elements of the group occur in exactly one coset, disregarding repeated cosets (i.e. no stragglers lurking outside a coset).     The result of these observations is that the group gets chopped up into disjoint subsets (cosets) all having the same number of elements in them. Since the cosets all have the same size as the subgroup used to generate them, this means that the size (or order) of the subgroup must divide the order of the original group. Hence since our group of functions had order 6, we should only expect a subgroup to have an order that is a divisor of 6. Again, as you noticed in part (k), the sizes of the subgroups were 1, 2, or 3 (all divisors of 6). We can't have a subgroup of, say order 5, if our group is of order 6 since 5 does not divide 6.  We have observed these patterns in the activity , but will this hold for all groups? In order to be certain, we need to prove it for all groups based on the basic properties of groups. Let's start by trying to argue these observations a little at a time.  One of the key parts of the argument deals with having all cosets being of the same \"size\" (actually the size of the subgroup that generated the coset). To establish that this was not just a fluke in our activity, we need to consider what would happen if cosets were not the same size as the subgroup that gave birth to them.    Coset \"Size\"   A left (or right) coset in a finite group contains the same number of elements as the subgroup that generated the coset.   Suppose (i.e. is a subgroup of ). Further, let . Now we can form a left coset, , such that . We can claim that all elements of this coset are unique since if not, we must have that , for some and with . But this would mean that  , and thus and so .      The next observation that we made in was that if we put all of the cosets together, we ended up with the entire group (as evidenced in your diagrams of cosets).    Union of Cosets is the Group   Let be a subgroup of a group . Then the union of all left cosets of gives the entire group . In other words, .   Since every left coset consists of elements from , then for all and . Therefore, we have . Now, if and since , we can see that every element of can be found in its respective coset, , since . Since , then and thus, every element in is also in . Therefore, . Since and , we have that . Note that this proof also works for right cosets.      The significance of this theorem is that a group can be formed by the union of all of its left (or right) cosets. But, could some of these cosets overlap in some way? If so, how can the elements from one coset overlap with another? Are there any restrictions on the overlap? You will recall experiencing this partitioning in lab when you placed boundaries around the subsets from that you found as a result of composing subgroups with elements from the set . You will also recall from the activity that the subsets (cosets) did not appear to overlap once you placed the boundaries around them. Put another way, the subsets generated in the activity either had no elements in common or were identical. While our experiences have suggested that there is no overlap, we do need to address this issue of possible overlap from a more formal and absolute sense. Consider the following theorem.    Coset Overlap   Let be a subgroup of a group and let . Then we have that any two left cosets and either have no elements in common or are identical.   Suppose and . This means that for some . Then we must also have that . This implies that for any , we can express for some since is closed. From this we can say that and thus every element in is also in implying . By a similar argument, we also get that , thus .      We now have everything we need to address the observation that you made from . Recall that when you examined the “powers” of the function composition in the activity, there was an interesting observation made, namely, the orders of the elements (functions in this case) seemed to be a divisor of the order of the group. This brings us to a classic theorem known as LaGrange's theorem .    LaGrange's Theorem   Let be a finite group or order, . If (i.e. is a subgroup of ), and , then .   Let be a finite group and with and . Since is finite and each left coset of has elements by with either left cosets being identical or disjoint as shown by , there must be a finite number, call it , of distinct left cosets of . Since every is guaranteed to be in the left coset and together the union of all left cosets gives as seen from , this implies that and thus .      Now that we have spent some time exploring basic properties in algebra through , we can start to examine how these structures relate to the secondary curriculum and how we can engage students in doing more than mimicking symbol manipulation without an understanding of the meaning behind the manipulation. As you discovered earlier, the most basic of structure in algebra is the group since the properties of a group are the minimal needed for use in solving an equation that uses only one operation. Let's now dig a little deeper into these ideas.    Algebraic Structure: Digging Deeper  In order to address the underlying structure of mathematics, we will examine a basic skill that is taught in the secondary schools from an advanced standpoint. At this point, it is assumed that the reader has experienced the corresponding parts of this text including the activity as well as the portions of the Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP) titled, Functions in Verse , Linear Functions in Verse , An Inventory of Inverses , and the Supplemental Problem, Its Own Inverse . In addition, it is also assumed that the reader has discussed the vignette, Inverse Functions: The Case of Tim ( ). These activities and curriculum materials are essential to give the reader a point of reference for this mathematical discussion on algebraic structure.        Before we begin an examination of algebraic structure and its relationship to the secondary curriculum, we first need to think about the basic components that make up different types of algebraic structures. Generally, when we think about algebra, be it at the secondary or undergraduate level, we have two basic components—a set and an operation or operations .  You may recall from your high school experience a great deal of time spent simplifying or solving expressions or equations that involved primarily the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In these cases, the operations were binary meaning that they took two elements in a set (say the real numbers) and returned another element from the same set. While the result of a binary operation does not have to be from the same set as the inputs, we will restrict our discussion to this case since it is the most familiar. For example, takes the two numbers 2 and 3 and returns the number 5. Similarly with multiplication, takes the two numbers 2 and 3 and returns the number 6.  Although arithmetic operations are the basis of many people's experience within the school setting, we can also think about non-arithmetic operations. Recall from your experiences in the activity, Form and Function , we used the operation of function composition. If you have ever worked a puzzle called Rubik's Cube , you have performed other non-arithmetic operations. In this case you can describe clockwise rotations of various faces as well as a myriad of other moves that transform the cube from one state to another. As we will see, whether we use arithmetic operations or non-arithmetic ones, there is an underlying structure that becomes evident as we notice patterns of behavior for elements of the set with which the operations are associated.       When we examine the solutions to basic equations, we notice a similar structure that occurs in all processes regardless of the binary operation being used. If we consider the solution to the equation for any binary operation, , the process used to find the solution is the same no matter what operation we choose. However, in order to use this process, there are some underlying assumptions that need to be stated.  Recall in and we determined the minimal properties needed to be able to solve an equation in one operation. These properties were what we used to define the most basic of algebraic structures, a group (see ). If we examined the steps used in the solution of each of these equations, we will noticed that the statements of properties and definitions as well as the order in which they were applied were identical. In fact, when I was writing these portions of the text, I simply copied and pasted the first solution into the document and then replaced all of the \" operations with “ \" and then all of the instances of \" \" were replaced with \" \". When we think about writing this section of the text in this way, the algebraic structure becomes very clear.       In order to study algebraic structure, we need to first consider the basic components that make up that structure. As we stated before, generally we think of sets and operations as the building blocks of an algebraic system. Young children become familiar with the concept of set from a very early age through the use of physical manipulatives, but what about operations? How do children view operations? One might argue that many children see arithmetic operations as physical actions that operate on sets of objects. After all, early development of the addition concept involves combining sets of objects.  Others might argue that many children see operations as a series of procedures to be performed using pencil and paper. Traditionally, in elementary school, a great deal of time is devoted to memorizing “addition facts” and “multiplication tables”. Of course, from a traditional point of view, knowing addition and multiplication facts is essential for mastery of the algorithms that follow. One goal of our existing curriculum is to enable students to compute sums and products efficiently and accurately. However, after observing children working on problems within a context, we have begun to question whether or not they make the connection between the earlier physical operations on sets and the arithmetic operations on numbers. In many cases, a child will be able to perform computations such as while at the same time struggle with a problem like:    Sue, Jan, and Amanda put equal amounts of money together and bought a large tub of candy containing 427 pieces. If they agree to split the candy equally, how many pieces does each get? Are there any pieces left over?    In many instances, the child is able to do the computation when posed simply as, , but does not necessarily have a conceptual understanding of what the quotient, remainder, or divisor represent. This disconnect between conceptual meaning and algorithmic procedure is concerning since in order to apply mathematical processes to real-world problems, the student must first understand what the process means so that it will be applied in an appropriate situation.  For example, in my early years of teaching, I has an experience teaching algebraic concepts related to distance, rate, and time. I asked a student the question, “If you drive at 55 mph for two hours, how far have you traveled?” Upon first consideration, the student simply looked puzzled. In response, thinking the student was having trouble doubling 55, I changed the problem by saying, “Suppose you drive at 60 mph for two hours, how far have you traveled?” I thought doubling 6 might be easier. The student replied, “Three miles.” What was the student doing? Upon further probing, it turns out that the student was simply dividing 60 by 2 (incorrectly) because he had been taught that you “divide when you have distance, rate, and time problems.” It comes as little surprise that this same student when posed with a new problem and asked how he might solve it responded, “Add…, no subtract…, no divide.” After uttering each response, he would watch my face looking for cues as to which operation was correct. I referred to this student approach as the “random operator generator”. It is important to note that this student was fairly proficient at computing with pencil and paper algorithms. The bottom line is that this student had very weak (if not nonexistent) connections between algorithmic procedures and conceptual understanding of the operations in question. If unable to make conceptual connections, there is very little chance that the student will be able to solve mathematical problems. So what good is computational proficiency, if the student does not know when it is appropriate to employ a certain type of computation?   Functions, Mappings, and Binary Operations   As we think about teaching children operations and the algebraic properties that are associated with them, it is helpful to put ourselves in the same unfamiliar position as our students by considering operations that are not familiar to us. But how do we create operations other than addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division? We could use operations from linear algebra where properties such as commutativity are no longer assumed. However, we can also create our own operations that are combinations of familiar ones. Once created, we can then investigate properties and even attempt to solve equations that use the operation.  Suppose we want to explore a binary operation, call it , on the set of real numbers defined by where \" \" and \" \" are the familiar operations of addition and multiplication. It would be nice if we could define this operation and then explore it using technology. In order to do this, let's first consider viewing a binary operation in a different way. As we discussed earlier, a binary operation takes two inputs, in this case from the set of real numbers, and yields a result that it also a real number. In algebra, we have seen another construct that also behaves in this manner (especially if we thinking back to Calculus 3). In a sense, a function takes inputs and produces outputs associated by the function rule. In this situation we want two inputs to yield a single output and so we can use a function of two variables. Here we can let a function, call it , be defined such that and . In this case, acts like the binary operation . The advantage of using a function approach to representing a binary operation is that we can use it to define the operation on a computer algebra system (CAS) and then explore the properties of “ ” via the symbol manipulation capabilities of the CAS.    Using Binary Operations   In this activity, we will explore a binary operation for which we have little intuition. This will allow us to focus on the meaning of algebraic properties more deeply since we cannot use our \"common knowledge\" to skip over how objects in a set (like the real numbers or integers) behave because we are too familiar with their behavior.  To begin, we are going to define the binary operation, , that was describe above on our CAS so that we can manipulate expressions more easily. To do this, let's define the operation by using a function of two variables calling it as shown below.    binary operation definition      Using your defined operation, , on your CAS, explain whether or not it meets the first property of a group, closure . You may want to try to compute several cases like the one shown above for to convince yourself one way or the other. Can you think of a case where it would not be closed for the integers? For the real numbers? Explain your reasoning.    Assuming we are using the real numbers, , as our set, compute several cases like and to give some evidence of whether or not the operation, , is associative. If it is, provide an argument to show it will be for any .    Determine if has an identity element for . If it does, what is it?    Determine if all elements of have an inverse under the operation . If so, does form a group? If not, can you slightly adjust the set so that it does form a group? Explain your reasoning.    Think back to basic operations like multiplication or addition with real numbers. Have you seen any type of operation that needs a slight adjustment in order to form a group? How does is the behavior from part (d) similar? How is it different?        Using your CAS and defining , find the solution(s) to the following equations. Be certain to state your CAS-defined operations and the commands you used to find the solution.         and      Consider the operation given by . Verify or refute the following properties. Assume the set under this operation is the set of real numbers. You may need to decide to restrict the set based on what you discover regarding the operation and its relationship to the properties (and a desire for it to be a group). If so, please explain your reasoning for the restriction.   Closure    Associativity    Identity    Inverses    Commutativity     Consider the operation given by . Verify or refute the following properties. Assume the set under this operation is the set of real numbers. You may need to decide to restrict the set based on what you discover regarding the operation and its relationship to the properties. If so, please explain your reasoning for the restriction.   Closure    Associativity    Identity    Inverses    Commutativity     Use your CAS to show that is a group under matrix multiplication. Further, show that also has the property of commutativity. A group that is also commutative is called abelian .    Show that the set of 8 symmetries of a square (four rotations and 4 flips) is a group.    Consider which is defined to be the set of all matrices of the form such that and . Show that is a group under matrix multiplication. This is called the special linear group —hence the “SL” in the notation.    Suppose that is a group and . Show that if , then .    Suppose that is a cyclic group. Explain why it must therefore be abelian . Note that if a group is cyclic, there must be at least one generator (i.e. an element for which all elements in can be expressed as a power of it).    Create a set of 8 complex numbers that form a cyclic group under multiplication and identify all elements of the group that are generators.   List all elements and their inverses.    Find the orders of each element of the group and describe any patterns you notice with respect to their inverse's order.     Let . Show that is a group under matrix multiplication. Explain why each element of has an inverse even though the matrices have determinants of 0.    "

To find an inverse function, the text that Tim is using begins by having the students swap the variables of and and then solve for . He is fairly confident that he can teach his students how to use this procedure to find inverse functions, but also noted that the book has students check to see if the inverse function works by composing the two functions to see if the composition results in “x”. Tim also noticed that the book covers function composition in the section before inverse function and assumes this is so that students can understand how to check their answers once they have found the inverse function. Since he wants to be sure the students are ready, he begins class by discussing the previous day's lesson on function composition.   Tim : OK, let's make sure we understand what we did yesterday since we are going to use it today. What is composition of functions?   Jen : Isn't it just sticking one thing into another?   Tim : Yes, it is. Can anyone show us how to do it? [ Lori raises her hand ]. Lori, go to the board. Can anyone give us two functions? [ Ken raises his hand ]. Ken, whatcha got?   Ken : How about and ?   Tim : Great. Now Lori, show us what to do.   Lori : OK, I guess it depends on what order you want.   Tim : Let's do .   Lori : So we just take and stick it in for in . That gives us . Now we can just distribute it out and that gives us .   Tim : Super! Is everyone OK with that? [ The class is quiet ]. Good, let's move on to today's stuff. Thanks, Lori. [ Lori sits down ].   Tim : Today we're going to look at inverses when it comes to functions. Has anyone ever heard the word “inverse” before? [ Several hands go up ]. Yeah, Mia.   Mia : Wouldn't that just be like the flip of a function?   Tim : [ Smiles ]. No, that's a common mistake. This is completely different when it comes to functions. Let's look at the book's way of finding inverse functions. In pairs, take a couple of minutes to read the procedure on page 213 (see ).    Excerpt from Tim's Text   Tim's Text     [ Students are given 5 minutes to read and discuss the procedure as Tim circulates observing their discussions. Tim notices that in the pair of Mike and Sam, Mike seems to be doing most of the explaining and so plans to call on Mike. ]   Tim : Mike, in your own words explain how to find inverse functions.   Mike : Well, first you just switch the and s. Then you just solve for so that is on one side of the equation and the other side just has s.   Tim : Very good. Let's do one together. Let's start with lines. How about the function we used earlier, . Tell me what to do. Yeah, Joan, get us started.   Joan : First write it as .   Tim : Now what? Someone else [ Hiro raises his hand ].

[ Kat raises her hand ]. Yeah, Kat.   Kat : How do we know it's the inverse function?   Tim : I'm glad you asked that, Kat. That's our next part of the lesson. To see if it worked, we just think of these as functions and compose them like we did yesterday. If we get “x”, then they are inverses. Let's try it. OK, let's make like we did before and now make . Sue, come to the board and work out this composition.   Sue : [ Sue goes to the board and begins writing. ] OK, we have . That gives . We can cancel the 3s and that leaves just and .

If you compose a function and its inverse you get . Let's do a few more and that might help with remembering it.   Kat : But why do we get ? Why don't we get 1?

  "title": "Form and Function.",
  "body": " Form and Function   This activity explores basic concepts of algebra including properties of algebraic structure. In high school, the primary operations used in algebra were multiplication and addition. Are these the only types of operations that can be used? We will explore this question and look for patterns that are common across algebra.  Recall that in your experiences in elementary school, you first learned to operate on the set of integers, , using a simple operation, addition. When this set was combined with the operation of addition, certain properties held. Some of these properties included: closure , associativity , the existence of an identity element, and inverses .  Consider the set of functions, , where the functions are defined as follows:     Mathematics can be described as the study of patterns. For this reason, we often look for similar structure in both nature and mathematical systems. Mathematics can certainly be used to study patterns in the physical world, but we can also look for patterns within mathematics itself. Are there times when one mathematical system is, for all practical purposes, “identical” to another mathematical system and therefore governed by the same properties and relationships? If this is so, then one system can give us quite a bit of information about another system. In fact, if one system is easier to operate on, we can use it instead and then deduce information about the other system without having to do more difficult computations.  In this activity, we will explore what properties exist when pairing the set above with the operation of composition of functions, . As you explore this set, try to keep your eyes open for patterns in the relationships among functions. Some properties you may want to check might include: closure, associativity, identity, inverses, and commutativity. For example, consider your experience with basic arithmetic. For addition on the set of integers, the set is closed since adding two integers always results in another integer. The number 0 acts as an identity (i.e. , leaving other elements unchanged) and 5 and -5 are inverses of each other (i.e. , where combining them yields 0, the identity). This type of structure is very important for deducing mathematical truths within a mathematical system.  To begin, we define the functions above on your computer algebra system. This has already been done for you on page 1.1 of the TI-Nspire CAS document. Once the functions are defined, build an operation table (called a Cayley table) for the composition of functions of the form in the space below by simply entering compositions such as and recording the result in the table as shown. This can be done more efficiently by first entering the functions in a spreadsheet (see page 1.2 of the FormFunction.tns file) and naming the entire set of functions “funset” and then performing compositions on the entire set all at once either on the Calculator page or in the Lists & Spreadsheets page (see ). If you use the spreadsheet, note that the columns in the spreadsheet correspond to rows in the table you are filling in due to the way the same operation is performed for an entire column in the spreadsheet. This syntax is similar to Microsoft Excel [i.e. by typing ].    Composing Functions on the the Calculator and Lists & Spreadsheets apps          Operation Table      In general, is the set  closed under the operation of composition of functions? In other words, when performing the operation on any two elements of the set, do you always get a result that is also an element of the set? If not, what elements yield an element not in ?    Recall that the associative property states that for any three elements under the operation, say , . How might you check associativity? How many different permutations of these functions would you need to check to be certain of associativity? Devise a plan to check associativity. Your plan might include other groups from the class (divide and conquer is often very effective).    Is there a function from the set that acts like an identity element? If so, what is the function?    Does every element have an inverse? If so, list all elements and their inverses. If not, list all elements that do have an inverse along with their inverse element.    Recall if a set along with an operation meets the four criteria of closure, associativity, an identity element, and all elements have inverses, then we call the set a group . Does this set of six functions under the operation of function composition form a group?    In general, do the elements of the set commute with each other? In other words, do you always get the same result when combining any two given elements in either order ( commutativity )? If all of the elements of a group commute with each other, then the group is called abelian . If a group is abelian, what kind of symmetry would you see in its Cayley table?    If the group is not abelian , for each element of , find all elements of that do commute with it. In other words, find all elements of that commute with , then all elements of that commute with , then all elements of that commute with , …etc. Here you might want to use the Cayley table you created earlier along with your answer regarding the symmetry of the table for commutativity from part (f). We call each of these sets the centralizer of the element, denoted , , .    Now list all of the elements that the sets you found in part (g) have in common. In other words, find . Since each of these elements must commute with each and every element of in order to be in the intersection, we call this special set of elements that commute with each other the center of  and denote it by .  If a group would be abelian , what elements would be in its center?    On the Calculator page (page 2.1) of your CAS, if , find if it is defined by . Note that a “power” here is not the usual “repeated multiplication”, but instead repeated composition of functions.    On page 2.2, use your algebraic spreadsheet to generate a sequence of . To do this, you can use the feature of the spreadsheet by first entering in the cell and then in cell entering . Then select cell and choose menu  followed by . Using the down arrow key, move down in the spreadsheet about 8 cells or so and press enter · (See screens below for setting up the recursive composition). For what powers of do you get ? Note that we labeled the column “kord” because this iteration will help us find what is called the order of the element .                  Using your algebraic spreadsheet to make a column for each function, repeat part (j) for the other functions in . Label the columns “ford”, “gord”, “hord”, …etc. List the elements in each set produced. For example, in using the element , you should get . You should notice that these elements just keep repeating and so the set is just limited to these three elements (note that when listing elements, we do not care about the order in which the elements are listed since they are just a set). Mathematically here we use the notation to mean the subgroup generated by  (i.e. repeatedly iterating with itself ). In this case, is finite with order 3 since it begins to repeat. What can you say about the sizes of these subsets? Here the \"size\" or number of elements in the subgroup is called the order of the subgroup. State any patterns you notice.                      List the smallest positive “power” for each element of that yields, [this is called the order of the element , denoted . You can also think of this as the number of elements in the subsets produced in part (k)]. State any relationship you see between these powers and the number of elements in set, .                      Do any of the subsets found in part (k) form a group? If so, we call them subgroups because they are a subset that is also a group? Groups or subgroups that have this repeating pattern when generated by a single element are called cyclic . List all of the subgroups you find. Explain how you know each is a group.    Subgroup   Let be a subset of elements from a group, . If the subset under the same operation used for forms a group, we call a subgroup , denoted .       Cyclic Groups and Subgroups   Let be an element of a finite group, . We can generate a subgroup, , of by taking an element and forming where we exhaust the powers of until we get the identity and it thus repeats. This subgroup, , is called a cyclic subgroup . We call the generator of the subgroup and denote . If , we say that is a cyclic group .     What do you think would happen if we composed a function not found in a specific subgroup with each element in that subgroup? To investigate this question, pick one of the subgroups generated in a column from part (k) and compose it with a function not in the subgroup. For example, using the subgroup and composing the elements with, say , we get the new set as shown below. This subset formed by composing with is denoted and called a coset . This can be done in either the Calculator page or the dynamic Notes page as shown below. Note that for your convenience, the Notes page (3.3) allows you to edit the subgroup at the top of the page and all cosets below it are automatically updated.    Coset   Let be a subgroup of a group . Let be any fixed element of . Then the set of all products of the form where is called a left coset for of in and is denoted by . Similarly, is called a right coset of in .             How many elements are in our new coset, ? Does the new coset form a subgroup? Use the Notes page (3.3) for composing the elements of with the other elements from not in . What do you notice? Describe what you observe if the other element is already in (e.g. compose with all elements from . Explain why your observations would be true.    Consider the following diagram of the set, . Draw a boundary around the cosets you found in part (n). An example of the boundary for the coset of the function composed with the subgroup is shown below. Describe what you notice about the coset boundaries you draw for each situation you found in part (n). Sketch a boundary around the resulting elements in below.    coset diagram 1      Now repeat what you did in parts (m) & (n) using each different subgroup you found in part (k), sketching boundaries around the cosets formed in the composition of all of the elements from with the subgroup. What can you say about the relationship among the cosets formed in each case?    coset diagram 1      Do all of the different cosets you found in part (p) form subgroups? If not, under what conditions do they form subgroups?    At this point our observations about the partitioning of a group into subsets is based solely on one example of a group. To test your conjectures, first confirm that the following set, , of matrices forms a group under the operation of regular matrix multiplication. To do this, first insert a new problem by pressing doc and selecting and then . After selecting a Calculator page, use the Define command to store each matrix by name in memory so that product of, say and , can be entered simply as on the CAS. Now create subgroups of the set by raising each element to increasing powers until you reach the identity, then repeat the process from parts (o) and (p) to see if the group of matrices is partitioned in a similar manner as was the set by sketching and circling subsets.       coset diagram 1      Using the evidence from your diagrams, give an argument for why the order of an element must divide the order of the group. Given that your argument is based on only a few cases of evidence (namely the sets and with various subgroups), what main properties would you need to show in order to prove your claim in general?

  "body": " Dopplegangers and the Multiverse   In the last section, we noticed that there were common behaviors among elements of groups. For example, we noticed that the order of an element or subgroup must divide the order of the group. We explored a few groups in that demonstrated these properties (one group was of order 6 and the other was or order 8). But what if we had another group of order 6? Would it also have the exact same behavior with one element of order 1, three elements of order 2, and two elements of order 3? Or could we have a different configuration of these elements? Also, recall that as we have stated earlier, Poincaré said,     Mathematicians do not study objects, but relations among objects; they are indifferent to the replacement of objects by others as long as relations do not change. Matter is not important, only form interests them. — Henri Poincaré .    So a natural question is, can we have two different sets and operations act in the same way? Poincaré suggested that we do not care so much about what the sets of objects are, just how that they interact with each other. In this section, we will explore this idea of behavior among different sets to see if we can infer behavior of one set of objects with an operation by looking at a different set of objects with a possibly different operation.
