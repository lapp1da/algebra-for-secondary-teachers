  "title": "A Brief History of Standards for Mathematics Education: Algebraic Perspectives",
  "body": " A Brief History of Standards for Mathematics Education: Algebraic Perspectives   Although the Principle and Standards for School Mathematics (PSSM) (NCTM, 2000) and the Common Core State Standards (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010) treat algebra as a standard for PreK-12, society tends to view algebra as a part of mathematics relegated to the secondary curriculum. In fact, even mathematicians often fail to understand how algebra could be taught to a first grader. Why is there such a misunderstanding between organizations such as NCTM and society? Why is there such a misunderstanding between NCTM and the mathematics community? Perhaps in order to understand why these differences in the perception of algebra exist, we must first look at the historical and traditional teaching of algebra in the United States.   Much of why we see slow advancement of educational practice is that humans are often change-averse. For example, consider the \"traditional\" secondary curriculum consisting of the sequence of courses: Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, and PreCalculus. Why are these courses in the sequence that they are? Doesn't it seem odd that Geometry is sandwiched between Algebra 1 and 2? Why are the subareas of mathematics separate at all? As it turns out, tradition is the real reason we see approaches like integrated curricula (which have much support from research) mounting so much resistance. The current sequence of Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, and PreCalculus actually dates back to 1894. Let me say that again, 1894 ! In 1894, the National Education Association (NEA) was dealing with the fact that very few students completed high school. There was a desire to make sure as many students as possible had some exposure to both algebra and geometry before leaving school. The solution — teach Algebra 1 followed immediately by Geometry. This means that the typical student would see both by the end of the sophomore year when they might leave formal education (Reys and Reys, 2009; NEA, 1894). So to sum things up, the current system typically used for secondary mathematics curricula dates back to a time over 125 years ago where the motivation was the fact that very few students finished high school. For this reason, as educators, we should always be asking ourselves why we do what we do? We need to look at the research and ask if the assumptions we make are still valid assumptions. The reasons, \"Because that's the way we've always done it\" or \"Because that's the way I learned it\" are not sufficient for rational decision making.  Given that our current curricular structure exists for reasons that are no longer relevant, we are faced with the reality that old choices also shape current perception of the mathematics we teach. For algebra, we need to ask the questions of what is algebra and why do we view it as we do, before we can address how best to teach it. Suppose you were to ask the person on the street to describe algebra. What sort of response would you get? What about mathematics in general? This question was asked of a student from a Minnesota high school during ABC's Primetime Live following the release of the results from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (ABC News, 1998). In response to this question she replied, “It's kind of a set in stone. It's procedure. It's a formula. You learn the formula and you know how to do math.”  Her perceptions of mathematics and, in particular, algebra, are not unique. In fact, the argument could be made that this is the perception of the majority of people — even those who are well educated. So, we must ask the question of why do so many people view mathematics as a set of procedures to be memorized? This question is of particular interest as we explore the teaching and learning of algebra since so many algebra texts are structured in such a way as to perpetuate this view.  Think back to your own algebra courses. What were the items you remember most from your textbooks? Can you recall shaded boxes housing formulae and “rules”? Do you recall the “Laws of Exponents” prominently displayed on the page? Did you ever think to question them? Or did you ever wonder why they were presented in the text before any examples like were even discussed? Maybe this is the reason society holds a very procedural and limited view of algebra.  In this text, we will explore not only the teaching and learning of algebra, but also the very nature of this branch of mathematics. If we wish to understand how students learn mathematics, we must first ask questions about the nature of the mathematics to be learned. If mathematics indeed is a set of procedures to be memorized as suggested in the quote given above, then there are certain strategies that can be employed to facilitate the memorization. This would then be an appropriate method of teaching. However, if the nature of mathematics is far more than the memorization of a set of rules, the strategies employed for learning mathematics will be completely different from those employed for memorization.  Traditionally, mathematical content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge have been the main parts of a dichotomous preparation program for teachers. Research suggests that this approach to the preparation of teachers is inadequate. How can we separate mathematics and the teaching and learning of mathematics? Is it possible to learn how to teach devoid of specific content knowledge? If so, then this would suggest that students learn language, social studies, art, science, and mathematics all the same way. While there are many common aspects of teaching and learning that resonate across many subject disciplines, the literature suggests that some disciplines have nuanced processes for learning that differ from other disciplines. So, if students learn different subjects differently, why do we tend to separate the mathematical content for preservice teachers from the pedagogical content? It is our opinion that both mathematical content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge need to develop simultaneously. For this reason, we will take a unified approach to integrate mathematical learning with the theories and practice for teaching.  We have now stated our position as it relates to the integration of mathematical and pedagogical content knowledge, but how should this integration be accomplished? In order to develop both mathematical and pedagogical content knowledge simultaneously, we first must ask ourselves how we come to know either of these. To this end, we now discuss the theoretical model that guides our approach and this text.   Pirie and Kieren Model for Mathematical Understanding   In order to understand the significance of both the explorations and the reflective practice combined in this text, we first will give an overview of the theoretical framework guiding our approach to the integration of mathematical and pedagogical content knowledge. We have adopted the theory of growth of mathematical understanding put forth by Pirie and Kieren (1994) as our model for these materials and this will guide both the mathematical learning experiences and the pedagogical reflection in which the reader will engage throughout this course. In addition, we will later utilize Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno's (2008) model that elaborates on the mechanisms at play as a learner moves through the levels found in the Pirie and Kieren model from a symbolic (or semiotic) point of view.   In order to understand the significance of both the explorations and the reflective practice combined in this text, we first will give an overview of the theoretical framework guiding our approach to the integration of mathematical and pedagogical content knowledge. We have adopted the theory of growth of mathematical understanding put forth by Pirie and Kieren (1994) as our model for these materials and this will guide both the mathematical learning experiences and the pedagogical reflection in which the reader will engage throughout this course. In addition, we will later utilize Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno's (2008) model that elaborates on the mechanisms at play as a learner moves through the levels found in the Pirie and Kieren model from a symbolic (or semiotic) point of view.  In the Pirie and Kieren model, the growth of mathematical understanding occurs throughout eight levels. We are careful here to use the word “throughout” since we do not want to give the impression that these levels are linear. In fact, their theory characterizes mathematical growth as a whole, dynamic, leveled but nonlinear, transcendently recursive process (Kieren and Pirie, 1991). The Pirie and Kieren model is an elaboration of the constructivist view of understanding as a continuing organization of knowledge structures as described by von Glasersfeld (1987), but we must also consider that we have the ability to influence and shape each others understanding because learning is a social process (Vygotsky, 1978). Freeman et al. (2014) suggest that active learning where students are engaged in experiences rather than passively listening to an instructor promotes greater depth of understanding and so we will take this approach in this text. In addition, communication also plays a role in our thinking as Sfard (2008) suggests and so we need to be mindful of these dynamically linked components of learning if we are to create an environment where exploration and student autonomy are key parts of concept development.  In order to visualize this model for growth of mathematical understanding consider the diagram below.    Pirie and Kieren's Model (1994, p. 167)     Here the model is viewed as concentric circles or layers with each new layer containing the previous layers much like peeling an onion. It is also important to note that there is not a single directional movement from inner to outer layers, but rather a student may move back and forth between layers as s\/he works on organizing knowledge in a dynamic process of creating understanding.  It is also important to state that although this model does have an underlying hierarchy to its levels or layers, there is no intentional judgment of the outer layers being better or more advanced mathematically. In fact, as new mathematics is developed we often see experienced mathematicians moving through various levels of this model. The innermost layer called, Primitive Knowing, does not imply a low-level understanding of concepts, but rather a basic series of knowledge and skills needed to pursue a new concept that is under development. For example, the Primitive Knowing layer for a new concept being developed by the learner may actually represent an outermost layer of understanding for a previously developed concept that is utilized in the development of the new concept. Pirie and Kieren use the example of fractions and decimals where a fairly sophisticated understanding of fractions is used as a starting point for the development of decimal concepts. In a sense, this could be thought of as an onion within an onion (see ) to use our “garden” variety analogy.    Nested Layers of Understanding (Pirie and Kieren, 1994, p. 172)     Now that we have an overview of how the levels of Pirie and Kieren's model fit together, let us discuss each level in more detail. The eight levels beginning with Primitive Knowing and ending with Inventizing can be characterized in the following way.     Primitive Knowing : The basic knowledge, skills, and understanding the learner has relative to the development of new understanding.    Image Making : The learner uses previous understanding in a new way to make distinctions and advance understanding through a process of concept development.     Image Having : The learner no longer must do the specific activities that brought about a mental construct, but can now use that construct directly.     Property Noticing : The learner can manipulate and use combinations of various parts of the newly developed mental images to construct pertinent features or properties within a specific context.     Formalizing : The learner can abstract characteristics from the prior image-dependent knowledge that exemplified the properties noticed in the earlier level.     Observing : The learner has the ability to reflect on formalizations and express these reflections as theorems.     Structuring : The learner begins to think about formal observations as an interconnected and interrelated set of theorems coming together to form a theory. The learner also now sees the need for verification and justification of mathematical propositions through proof or arguments.     Inventizing : The learner has a deeply developed and structured understanding of the topic and can move away from the basic concepts that gave rise to the understanding and ask new questions that might lead to the development of new concepts.      One feature of the Pirie and Kieren theory that relates to the teaching and learning of algebra specifically is the description of progression of abstraction from a symbolic sense. You may have noticed some bold rings in the diagram above ( ) describing the layers involved in this model. These bold rings are referred to as the “don't need” boundaries. The bold rings are used to convey the idea that once students get past a “don't need” boundary, they can now work in a more abstract sense without accessing specific inner understanding or images that were found within the bold boundary that gave rise to the understanding that is found in the outer region. This is a significant part of the theory as it relates to algebra since one of the most important goals of the teaching and learning of algebra is bringing the student to higher and higher levels of abstraction. We will address the role of abstraction in greater detail later, but here it is important to point out this aspect of the general theory guiding the text.  To this point we have simply described the nature of each level of the Pirie and Kieren model and how they fit together, but there is a more powerful aspect of the theory that makes it particularly useful in grappling with how mathematical understanding comes to be. In order to explain mathematical understanding, we need to include a mechanism for explaining the growth. In the Pirie and Kieren model, this mechanism is called folding back .  It is important to acknowledge that as we learn, there are varying depths of our understanding as related to any particular topic or concept. We have all experienced this when we first learn about a new idea and can even use that mathematical idea to solve problems only to later encounter the same idea within a different context and be surprised by the new application of such an old idea. This element of surprise is the evidence that our understanding of that idea has just deepened. Pirie and Kieren account for this growth in the depth of understanding through the construct of folding back . Basically, folding back is the learner's ability to revert back to an inner layer of the understanding process in order to make sense of a situation or problem that is not readily solvable or understandable at the learner’s current level. It is important to note that this return to prior levels is not similar to the experience the learner had previously in that earlier level, but rather is also influenced by the deeper understanding that has been obtained in the outer level as well. The re-visitation to the inner level results in what Pirie and Kieren refer to as a thickening of the inner layer. There is no unique pathway in which this thickening occurs since the number and manner of the folds backward are unique to the individual learner. This process emphasizes that the levels or layers of this model of mathematical understanding do not occur in a single direction, but occur in a series of steps that involve the interactions of both older and newer levels of understanding.  The third and final feature of Pirie and Kieren's model we wish to highlight is the structure that takes place within each layer or level. Here, for each level beyond Primitive Knowing the levels are partitioned into two complementary modes: acting and expressing. Both of these components of understanding are essential before moving on from the inner to the outer levels. This elaboration of the model is given a graphic interpretation below with dotted lines representing the boundaries between modes.    Pirie and Kieren's Extended Model (1994, p. 176)      "

  "title": "Elementary Concepts of Number",
  "body": " Elementary Concepts of Number   Throughout mathematics, humankind has found the need to expand its numeration systems. While some cultures developed symbol systems to represent the concept of number, others relied (and still rely on) linguistic representations. For example, some studies suggest that the Pirahã tribe in Brazil have a limited system consisting of just \"one\", \"two\", and \"many\". Scholars are still debating this tribe's concept of number, but one might ask, why only three words for numbers? As we examine the concept of number, it is important to realize that number is usually tied to a culture. Imagine a culture where people possess very few things. If there is no need to keep track of possessions, why invent a number representation to express them? If very few people have more than two of anything and there is no need to compare quantities, why bother? \"Many\" should suffice. Throughout history, we will see that the expansion of a number system is usually triggered by a necessity for describing amounts or quantities.    Elementary Whole Number Systems  One of the earliest numeration systems was the tally system or what we like to call the WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) system. In this system, simple tally marks represented a number. For example, suppose you had seven bags of grain. In the tally system, the person would represent their possessions as |||||||. As you can imagine, this would be fine if you had little, but if you had many possessions, it would quickly become cumbersome. The Egyptians developed a way of eliminating the need for tally marks by inventing new symbols to represent groups of objects. In this case, the Egyptians grouped by ten (probably due to the fact that people had ten fingers and when counting on fingers, to keep track, they would need to begin again on the first hand after counting to ten). Once they collected ten of something, they created a new symbol to represent a bundle of ten. Once ten of those bundles were gathered, they created another symbol to represent ten bundles of ten and so on (see ). This way, to write a numeral, they would never need to have any more than nine of any symbol. They used the following symbols to represent various powers of ten.    Egyptian Numeral System     With each different symbol, the Egyptians could now write larger numbers using a more condensed collection of symbols than in a tally system. For example, suppose we wish to express the number 31,254. In our Hindu-Arabic system, we allow each space to represent a different power of the base (ten in this case). Thus, expressed in expanded base-ten notation. The Egyptians, on the other hand, did not use the spatial location of the symbols to convey the specific power of the base, but rather they created a different symbol for each power (size bundle). Therefore, the number 31,254 would be written as    Egyptian Numeral for 31,254     Although this system was a great improvement over the tally system of numeration, it doesn't take long to see a major drawback. Since each new power of the base requires a new symbol, expressing larger and larger numbers becomes cumbersome. In order to express any given positive integer, the Egyptian system requires an infinite number of symbols.     Consider the following numerals written in our standard Hindu-Arabic system.    Write 7,521 in the Egyptian system.    Write 582,346 in the Egyptian system.    Write 2,141,425 in the Egyptian system.     So how do we improve on the problem of needing to create new symbols for each power of ten (or any base for that matter)? The ancient Babylonians developed a place-value system for representing any positive integer using a finite number of symbols. The Babylonians used the position of the symbol or collection of symbols to represent the power of the base (in this case a base sixty system which meant that in any single position, the symbols could total at most fifty-nine). Although they bundled in groups of sixty, they had only two symbols along with a place holder to be used for when there were no bundles of a certain power of the base (see ). The early Babylonians did not use the place holder, but the confusion caused by not being able to indicated easily when there were no bundles of a certain size necessitated the creation of a symbol to \"hold an open space\". The Babylonians did not have a fully functioning zero, but the place holder provided a way to indicate no bundles of a specific size by its location in the string of symbols.    Babylonian Numeration Symbols     To illustrate, consider the expanded base sixty notation as written using our familiar Hindu-Arabic numerals. Here we have . And so the early Babylonians would write this number as     The problem was in how this numeral could be interpreted. Did this collection of symbols mean or ?  To make this expression less ambiguous, the placeholder was used to express the meaning more clearly. Thus the later Babylonian system would write the intended number as     As we shared before, although the use of the placeholder serves the same role as our zero in the Hindu-Arabic system, the Babylonians did not recognize the concept of zero as being a number representing nothing.     Consider the following numerals written in our standard Hindu-Arabic system.    Write 1,422 in the Babylonian system.   How many bundles are there of size , , , etc.?    Write 1,123,426 in the Babylonian system.   How many bundles are there of size , , , etc.?    Write 147,637 in the Babylonian system.   How many bundles are there of size , , , etc.?     The ancient Mayan civilization were probably the first to fully recognize the concept of zero. The Mayans also used a place-value numeration system. In this case, their grouping number was twenty. They actually had a pseudo base twenty system since their place values progressed as: . The reason for the deviation from was due to their calendar that had 18 months with 20 days per month ( ). Like the Babylonians, the Mayans had very few symbols. The difference is that the Mayans had a symbol for zero (or nothing) represented by an empty oyster shell. This was different from the Babylonians in that the Mayan's symbol was not just a placeholder, but rather was a symbol representing nothingness. The symbols are given below.    Mayan Numeration Symbols     Like the Babylonians, the position of the collection of symbols determined the power of the base. However, unlike the Babylonians, the Mayan base is not exactly uniform. Instead of a base twenty system, they used a pseudo-base twenty system . The reason for this is that the base was tied to their calendar year. The Mayan calendar contained 18 months each containing 20 days. The result was a 360-day year. This can be seen below by the replacement of the normal place value, , with the place value of . After this, the place values simply increase the power of 20 by one for each successive place. The Mayans wrote the numerals vertically with the higher powers of the base above the lower powers and the symbol for zero was used as a placeholder. For example, the number , in Hindu-Arabic would be written as     To this point, civilizations had focused mainly on representing the natural or counting numbers, . The Mayans extended this system to include zero , often referred to as the whole numbers . Some texts include 0 in the set of natural numbers and refer to the counting numbers as the positive integers, denoted . Thus, the use of seems to be less ambiguous since zero is neither positive nor negative and so we will use .  With the advancement of a place-value system, cultures evolved to use different symbols for each face value (i.e. the symbols used to represent the number of any particular sized bundle). These symbols were dependent on the base (or bundle size) that was used. For example, in our current commonly used base system, (base ten), we have ten symbols since once we get ten of anything, we bundle them and we create another bundle of the next place value space. For base six, there would be six symbols. For base, there would be three symbols, and so on. Therefore, in base ten, we have the symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The symbols used here are the Hindu-Arabic numerals (not to be confused with Arabic numerals) used on many Middle Eastern countries (see ). Both use a base-ten place-value system.    Arabic vs Hindu-Arabic Numerals     An interesting fact is that even though Arabic is written right-to-left, the numerals are still written left-to-right. This is due to the fact that the symbols were adopted from India where language is written left-to-right. This means that while reading text, you would read right-to-left until reaching a numeral and then switch to left-to-right for the number and then switch back to right-to-left as you continue to read the text. Again, this shows how mathematics and language are both culturally connected. Below ( ) is a picture of a license plate from Iraq from 2025. This would be read as 656874 in our Hindu-Arabic symbols. Iraq was in the process to switching to the use of the Western Hindu-Arabic numerals at the time and this is an older plate that had not yet been replaced.    Arabic License Plate (photo credit Noah Lapp)        In this activity, we will explore how different bundling sizes impact the way numerals are used to represent a whole number. In and you see videos that show how place value is used to express the number \"twenty-three\". Notice that we use the English term \"twenty-three\" here since the number \"twenty-three\" will look different as a collection of numerals or digits depending on how we decide to bundle.    Begin by counting out forty-three bundling sticks. Form as many bundles of ten as you can and record the number of bundles of size ten along with any remaining sticks left unbundled using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.    Bundling By Ten    Bundles of Ten  Leftover Units                                                                                Write a base ten numeral for this amount: _________________________    Starting over with the same forty-three bundling sticks. Form as many bundles of eight as you can and record the number of bundles of size eight along with any remaining sticks left unbundled using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.    Bundling By Eight    Bundles of Eight  Leftover Units                                                                                Write a base eight numeral for this amount: _________________________    Starting over with the same forty-three bundling sticks. Form as many bundles of six as you can and record the number of bundles of size six along with any remaining sticks left unbundled using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If you get six bundles of six, form a \"super bundle\".    Bundling By Six    Six Bundles of Six  Bundles of Six  Leftover Units                                                                                                        Write a base six numeral for this amount: _________________________    Starting over with the same forty-three bundling sticks. Form as many bundles of five as you can and record the number of bundles of size five along with any remaining sticks left unbundled using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If you get five bundles of five, form a \"super bundle\".    Bundling By Five    Five Bundles of Five  Bundles of Five  Leftover Units                                                                                                        Write a base five numeral for this amount: _________________________    Based on your responses from the earlier part of this activity, we can say that the same forty-three sticks can be expressed as:     ___________ ___________ ___________         Using Bundling Sticks to Represent Twenty-Three       Using Base Blocks to Represent Twenty-Three    As time went on, the need arose to represent the concept of debt. Since people had created the whole numbers, people again chose to extend the current number system to accommodate the need to represent quantities that were the \"opposite\" of the positive integers. Thus, the accepted set of numbers became the integers , denoted .    Rational and Irrational Numbers  Eventually, there was a need to represent quantities that were smaller than a whole unit (for a fun cartoon see below) and so the rational numbers again extended the known set of numbers. To the Greeks, all quantities could be expressed as the quotient of two integers and so the rational numbers, denoted , came to be the accepted system of numbers.     The Weird Number     "

  "body": "  In this activity, we will explore how different bundling sizes impact the way numerals are used to represent a whole number. In and you see videos that show how place value is used to express the number \"twenty-three\". Notice that we use the English term \"twenty-three\" here since the number \"twenty-three\" will look different as a collection of numerals or digits depending on how we decide to bundle.    Begin by counting out forty-three bundling sticks. Form as many bundles of ten as you can and record the number of bundles of size ten along with any remaining sticks left unbundled using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.    Bundling By Ten    Bundles of Ten  Leftover Units                                                                                Write a base ten numeral for this amount: _________________________    Starting over with the same forty-three bundling sticks. Form as many bundles of eight as you can and record the number of bundles of size eight along with any remaining sticks left unbundled using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.    Bundling By Eight    Bundles of Eight  Leftover Units                                                                                Write a base eight numeral for this amount: _________________________    Starting over with the same forty-three bundling sticks. Form as many bundles of six as you can and record the number of bundles of size six along with any remaining sticks left unbundled using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If you get six bundles of six, form a \"super bundle\".    Bundling By Six    Six Bundles of Six  Bundles of Six  Leftover Units                                                                                                        Write a base six numeral for this amount: _________________________    Starting over with the same forty-three bundling sticks. Form as many bundles of five as you can and record the number of bundles of size five along with any remaining sticks left unbundled using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If you get five bundles of five, form a \"super bundle\".    Bundling By Five    Five Bundles of Five  Bundles of Five  Leftover Units                                                                                                        Write a base five numeral for this amount: _________________________    Based on your responses from the earlier part of this activity, we can say that the same forty-three sticks can be expressed as:     ___________ ___________ ___________    "
