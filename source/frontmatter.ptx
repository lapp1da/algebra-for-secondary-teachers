    <p>
      I want to dedicate this text to my wonderful wife, Kim, whose sacrifices and support have always 
      made my professional goals possible.  She was willing to limit her own professional ambitions to 
      accommodate my needs.  Thank you and I love you!
    </p>
    <p>
      I also want to thank my kids, Noah, Ellen, and Sarah, for being my inspiration in the teaching and 
      learning of mathematics.  For two of them, I had the pleasure of actually being their professor and 
      they have given me insights into how students learn mathematics.  They all have been supportive of my 
      professional life.  I love you all!

    This book is an application of research I have conducted on the teaching and learning of 
    algebra at both the K-12 and the university levels.  My work was influenced by many scholars, but in 
    particular, the work of the late Dr. Jim Kaput, as well as Dr. Kathy Heid, Dr. Rose Zbiek, and 
    Dr. Anna Sfard stand out as those who have profoundly shaped my thinking.
