  <title>Introduction to Mathematical Standards</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
      As with all fields of study, most professions are governed by a set of standards.  In health professions, 
      each profession such as the <em>American Medical Association</em> or the <em>American Society of Hospital 
      Pharmacists</em> create standards for acceptable practice in their profession.  It should come as no 
      surprise that mathematics teachers do the same.  In fact, those who teach mathematics at all levels are 
      members of organizations that create standards for the teaching and learning of mathematics.  At the 
      college and univeristy level, organizations such as the <em>Mathematical Association of America</em> (MAA) 
      and the <em>American Mathematical Society</em> (AMS) take on this task.  At the PK-12 level, this task of 
      developing standards falls both on professional organizations, <em>National Council of Teachers of 
      Mathematics</em> (NCTM), and each state since the oversight of education in the US is left to the 
      individual States.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the individual states have the ability to develop their own standards, you can imagine how different 
      these standards could look.  With such potentially different standards from state-to-state, eventually, 
      it began to cause challenges as families (and their students) needed to move to different states.  A child 
      could end up moving from a state where they were well on track with that state's curriculum only to find 
      themselves woefully behind the expectations in another state.  For mathematics, it wasn't until 1989 that 
      NCTM created the first set of guidelines (or Standards) to help all states deal with this problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1989, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics published its <em>Curriculum and Evaluation 
      Standards for School Mathematics</em> (NCTM, 1989) followed in 1991 by the <em>Professional Teaching 
      Standards</em> and the <em>Assessment Standards</em> in 1995.  While these standards were research-based, 
      the text of the standards did not adequately show the connections to the research that some critics 
      would like and so in 2000, a new and more comprehensive version was developed called the <em>Principles 
      and Standards for School Mathematics (PSSM)</em> (NCTM, 2000).  
    </p>

    <p>
      While the PSSM developed by NCTM gave guidance to states for what content and pedagogical techniques 
      should be used at various grade levels, it still is technically the pervue of the individual states to 
      decide the content and methods for teaching various subject areas.  NCTM did not have any power to 
      enforce the teaching of mathematics in accordance with the PSSM.  Therefore, there needed to be some 
      agreement among states in order to deal with consistency across the nation with respect to what 
      mathematics is taught and how it is to be taught.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to give some method of enforcement to the vision of the NCTM's PSSM, The National Governors 
      Association Center for Best Practices and the Council of Chief State School Officers developed the 
      <em>Common Core State Standards (2010)</em> <url href="https://www.thecorestandards.org" 
      visual="thecorestandards.org">CCSS Website</url>.  This project developed standards for both Mathematics and English.  
      The given website gives current state acceptance of these standards.  The CCSS specific for Mathematics 
      can be found in pdf form at
