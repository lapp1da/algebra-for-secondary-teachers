  <title>Extending the Number System: Complex Numbers</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Throughout history, our number system has evolved primarily driven by necessity.  It should come as no 
      surprise that our current system (the complex numbers) was also driven by an issue with the real number 
      system.  On of the motivators was the search for real solutions to equations, in particular, polynomial 
      equations.  The solution to the general quadratic equation, <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m>, had beeen established as 
      <me>
        x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
      </me>
      but there was still some concern for the situation when a negative appeared under the radical.  Putting 
      these negative square roots aside, the usefulness of the real solutions found with the quadratic 
      formula was considered a leap forward.

      However, there was still a search for a solution to the general cubic, <m>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0</m>.  At the 
      time, the solution to some forms of the cubic had been found.  For example, if a cubic was in the form, 
      <m>x^3+mx=n</m>, where the squared term was not present, Ferro had found a way to solve it by "depressing" 
      the general cubic was still out of reach.
