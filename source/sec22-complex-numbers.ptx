  <title>Extending the Number System: Complex Numbers</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Throughout history, our number system has evolved primarily driven by necessity.  It should come as no 
      surprise that our current system (the complex numbers) was also driven by an issue with the real number 
      system.  On of the motivators was the search for real solutions to equations, in particular, polynomial 
      equations.  The solution to the general quadratic equation, <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m>, had beeen established as 
      <me>
        x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
      </me>
      but there was still some concern for the situation when a negative appeared under the radical.  Putting 
      these negative square roots aside, the usefulness of the real solutions found with the quadratic 
      formula was considered a leap forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1494, Luca Picioli published is volume, <em>Summa de Arithmetica</em>, where he examined linear and 
      quadratic equations.  However, there was still a search for a solution to the general cubic, 
      <m>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0</m>.  At the time, the solution to some forms of the cubic had been found.  For 
      example, Scipione del Ferro had found a way to solve the "depressed" cubic (meaning one without the squared 
      term) of the form, <m>x^3+mx=n</m>, but the general cubic was still out of reach and Picioli did not have 
      high hopes that a solution to the general cubic could be found.  In his work, Picioli began to 
      experiment with more symbolic notation using the symbol, <em>co</em>, to denote a variable (here <em>co</em>
      was short for <em>cosa</em>, Italian for "thing" or "thing to be found"), and was a leap forward in 
      compressing notation so that ideas could be expressed in a smaller visual space reducing the number of 
      words used in formalizing mathematical arguments.  We will address the importance of compressed expressions 
      with respect to Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno's (2008) model for the development of symbolic meaning later, 
      but for now, it suffices to say, mathematics was on the verge of significant advancement.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Scipione del Ferro had kept his discovery for finding a solution to <m>x^3+mx=n</m> a secret as was often the 
      practice of the time, since academic appointments were not very secure and mathematicians could be 
      "dethroned" from their positions by being challenged.  Upon his death, he passed his solution to his student, 
      Antonio Fior.  Now Fior was not nearly as good of a mathematician as del Ferro, but was a bit more brash.

    <p>
      As with many mathematical advancements, we often begin by taking something we do not know how to solve and 
      turning it into something we do know how to solve.  So, how to we take the general cubic, 
      <m>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0</m>, and turn it into <m>x^3+mx=n</m> that del Ferro had already solved?  In other 
      words, how do we "depress" the cubic?

      The secondary school curriculum includes the teaching of complex numbers even though some aspects of this 
      are not required for all students graduating from high school.  Note that the Common Core State 
      Standards denote this with a (+) symbol next to those topics not expected for all students.  However, 
      all secondary teachers must be expected to teach these concepts and certainly any student planning to 
      enter scientific fields should be expected to leave high school having exerpience with complex numbers.  
      Below in <xref ref="fig-ccss-complex-numbers"/> are the standards from the CCSS with regard to complex 
      numbers.
