  <title>Extending the Number System: Complex Numbers</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Throughout history, our number system has evolved primarily driven by necessity.  It should come as no 
      surprise that our current system (the complex numbers) was also driven by an issue with the real number 
      system.  One of the motivators was the search for real solutions to equations, in particular, polynomial 
      equations.  The solution to the general quadratic equation, <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m>, had beeen established as 
      <me>
        x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
      </me>
      but there was still some concern for the situation when a negative appeared under the radical.  Putting 
      these negative square roots aside, the usefulness of the real solutions found with the quadratic 
      formula was considered a leap forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1494, Luca Picioli published his volume, <em>Summa de Arithmetica</em>, where he examined linear and 
      quadratic equations.  However, there was still a search for a solution to the general cubic, 
      <m>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0</m>.  At the time, the solution to some forms of the cubic had been found.  For 
      example, Scipione del Ferro had found a way to solve the "depressed" cubic (meaning one without the squared 
      term) of the form, <m>x^3+mx=n</m>, but the general cubic was still out of reach and Picioli did not have 
      high hopes that a solution to the general cubic could be found.  In his work, Picioli began to 
      experiment with more symbolic notation using the symbol, <em>co</em>, to denote a variable (here <em>co</em>
      was short for <em>cosa</em>, Italian for "thing" or "thing to be found"), and was a leap forward in 
      compressing notation so that ideas could be expressed in a smaller visual space reducing the number of 
      words used in formalizing mathematical arguments.  We will address the importance of compressed expressions 
      with respect to Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno's (2008) model for the development of symbolic meaning later, 
      but for now, it suffices to say, mathematics was on the verge of significant advancement.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Scipione del Ferro had kept his discovery for finding a solution to <m>x^3+mx=n</m> a secret as was often the 
      practice of the time, since academic appointments were not very secure and mathematicians could be 
      "dethroned" from their positions by being challenged.  Upon his death, he passed his solution to his student, 
      Antonio Fior.  Now Fior was not nearly as good of a mathematician as del Ferro, but was a bit more brash.  
      Fior began challenging mathematicians since he knew all he had to do was give them depressed cubics that 
      only he alone knew how to solve and he would be the victor.  As fate would have it, Fior chose to 
      challenge the Brescian scholar, Niccolo Fontana.  Now Fontana was a brilliant mathematician, but was 
      disfigured by the sword of a French soldier as a child and his deformity caused him to speak with a 
      stammer.  He was therefore more commonly known by the cruel epithet, Tartaglia (The Stammerer).  Well, 
      Tartaglia began to attack Fior's challenge of 30 depressed cubics, but had not made much progress.  As the 
      time to submit his final solutions approached, on February 13, 1535, he had a breakthrough and discovered 
      the solution to the depressed cubic, <m>x^3+mx=n</m>, defeating his challenger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that Tartaglia had mastered the depressed cubic, another brilliant mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano, 
      sought an audience with Tartaglia in hopes of learning the solution to the depressed cubic.  Tartaglia 
      refused to reveal his secret, but after many other attempts at persuasion, Tartaglia finally relented with 
      the caveat that Cardano would not reveal or publish the solution.  Cardano gladly accepted the terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Enter the young 20-year-old mathematician, Ludovico Ferrari.  Ferrari approached Cardano asking for work and 
      they soon forged a partnership.  With their collaboration, Cardano found a way to depress the general 
      cubic, <m>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0</m>, into one of the form, <m>x^3+mx=n</m>.  However, Cardano's dilemma was 
      that in order to publish his solution to the general cubic, he would then need to use Tartaglia's solution 
      for the depressed cubic and he had vowed not to reveal it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stymied by his moral dilemma, in 1543, Cardano and Ferrari went to Bologna to explore the works of 
      del Ferro.  To their surprise, they found that del Ferro had actually written down his original solution 
      to the depressed cubic, prior to Tartaglia discovering it.  Since he could now state that he got the 
      solution to the depressed cubic from del Ferro and not Tartaglia, Cardano was now free to publish the 
      solution to the general cubic.  When his work, <em>Ars Magna</em> was published, it was earth shattering 
      news to the mathematical community.

              Well, it worked for the cubic.  What about the quadratic?  Enter the general quadratic, 
              <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m>, on your CAS.  Now using the "such that" key, |, make the substitution,

    <p>
      So now you are wondering, how is this historical trip relevant to complex numbers?  As it turns out, using 
      Cardano's process for finding solutions to the general cubic, at stages of the process, the pesky number, 
      <m>\sqrt{-1}</m>, shows up.  However, when continuing the process, we can have the <m>\sqrt{-1}</m> 
      resolved by squaring and thus obtain <em>real</em> solutions in the end.  So in order to obtain 
      real solutions to the general cubic, mathematicians had to "tip-toe" through the imaginary, 
      <m>i=\sqrt{-1}</m>, and this was uncomfortable.  With the quadratic formula, we could just ignore the 
      messy <m>\sqrt{-1}</m> since those solutions weren't real anyway, but here, we have to put up with 
      <m>\sqrt{-1}</m> to arrive at real solutions.  Mathematicians could no longer simply turn a blind eye, 
      but had to face that such numbers must exist.

    <title>Complex Numbers and the Common Core State Standards</title>
    <p>
      The secondary school curriculum includes the teaching of complex numbers even though some aspects of this 
      are not required for all students graduating from high school.  Note that the Common Core State 
      Standards denote this with a (+) symbol next to those topics not expected for all students.  However, 
      all secondary teachers must be expected to teach these concepts and certainly any student planning to 
      enter scientific fields should be expected to leave high school having exerpience with complex numbers.  
      Below in <xref ref="fig-ccss-complex-numbers"/> are the standards from the CCSS with regard to complex

      “When will I ever teach this?”  You most likely have uttered this statement while taking undergraduate 
      mathematics courses as part of your teacher preparation program.  The purpose of this section is to 
      highlight examples of where the secondary mathematics curriculum and the undergraduate mathematics 
      curriculum are inextricably connected.  To begin this discussion, we may want to brush up on some 
      mathematical ideas on which a teacher tasked with teaching complex numbers may rely.  The Core-Plus 
      curriculum is counting on connections and is designed to take advantage of a variety of mathematical 
      concepts as the complex number system is explored.

        <p>
          Now that you have started to reflect on the mathematics and pedagogy present in these explorations, 
          consider the following classroom situation where a teacher (Jan) is questioned by her students.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jan has been teaching polynomials and factoring out of Lesson 2 of the <em>Contemporary Mathematics in 
            Context: A Unified Approach (Core-Plus)</em> curriculum.  She assigned students to work on the 
            “On Your Own” question found on page 385 of book 4B as well as the “Extending” questions found on 
            pages 402-403 (see <xref ref="fig-core-plus-on-your-own-1"/> and 
            <xref ref="fig-core-plus-on-your-own-2"/>).  During the next class period, she facilitated a 
            discussion of the homework assignment.  Within the discussion, Jeff asked, “I was able to do the 
            error function graphs and I understand that the longer the polynomial, the closer we get to matching 
            the sine function, but how did they come up with those polynomial functions?  They all have weird 
            coefficients and stuff.”

            <p>
              Explain how you would respond to Jeff's question.  Keep in mind that Jeff is in his fourth year 
              of high school mathematics and has been exposed to the concept of derivative earlier in book 4A.

      Depdending on when you are taking this course, you may or may not have completed Calculus 2.  In order to 
      have productive conversations about this classroom scenario, we should take a moment to either examine or 
      brush up on some content from Calculus 2.  In this next activity, we will revisit some of these main 
      concepts, so if you have already been exposed to an activity such as this, please don't spoil it for

        <title>Impersonating Functions</title>
        
        <introduction>
          <p>
            This activity explores basic concepts of algebra and calculus involved in using power series to 
            imitate transcendental functions.  In particular, the series for <m>\sin\left(x\right)</m>,
            <m>\cos\left(x\right)</m>, and <m>e^x</m> are investigated and connections are made with practical 
            uses of such functions for creating computing algorithms used by calculators and computers to 
            evaluate numerical approximations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Have you ever wondered how your calculator knows what the <m>\ln\left(5\right)</m> or the 
            <m>\sin\left(0.7\right)</m> is or how it can find decimals for numbers like <m>\sqrt{3}</m>?  Did 
            someone program every possible square root, trig value, or logarithm into the machine?  Wouldn't 
            that take up a tremendous amount of memory?  Well, the answer is that your calculator knows how to 
            use basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to approximate these 
            types of values to the desired decimal accuracy.  In this exploration you will first investigate how 
            we can approximate more complicated transcendental functions using simple polynomials.  Once we 
            establish this method for approximating functions with polynomials, we will then use it to explore 
            a surprising connection between trigonometry and the complex number systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            To this point we have seen that if we zoom in far enough, a function looks a great deal like a 
            straight line.  But how does this help us impersonate more complicated functions like <m>e^x</m>?

              Graph <m>y=e^x</m> along with several possible linear functions that would look like the 
              “linear-looking” graph of <m>y=e^x</m> when you zoom in near <m>x=0</m>.  Remember, you need the 
              linear function to have the same slope as <m>y=e^x</m> and also have the same point in common 
              with <m>y=e^x</m> at zero.  Record the lines you tried along with brief explanations for why you 
              tried those particular lines.  Give your final line that you feel best imitates <m>y=e^x</m> at

              along with <m>y=e^x</m> on the same window.  Zoom out and give an approximation of the interval 
              about <m>x=0</m> where your line is a “fairly close” imitation of <m>y=e^x</m>.

              Suppose you want to imitate <m>y=e^x</m> within a larger interval.  Since <m>y=e^x</m> is not 
              linear, we need a function that curves so that it will “hug” the graph of <m>y=e^x</m> through a 
              larger interval.  Since quadratics are curved, experiment with your linear function from part (a) 
              by adding on a term of the form <m>ax^2</m>.  Record your choices for <m>a</m> along with sketches 
              of your new quadratic function and <m>y=e^x</m> on the same axes.  Give your final choice of 
              quadratic function of the form <m>ax^2+bx+c</m> that best imitates <m>y=e^x</m> near <m>x=0</m>.

              You have now been able to extend the size of the interval where <m>y=e^x</m> can be imitated by a 
              polynomial by adding on a higher degree polynomial term.  Can this continue?  Take the quadratic 
              function you have developed in part (c) and try to extend the interval of imitation further by 
              adding on a third-degree term and experimenting with its coefficient. Give your final choice of 
              cubic function of the form <m>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d</m> that best imitates <m>y=e^x</m> near <m>x=0</m> 
              and sketch your graph of <m>y=e^x</m> along with your cubic.

            <p>
              The polynomials you have created to imitate the function <m>y=e^x</m> are called Taylor polynomials 
              named for the mathematician, Brook Taylor.  To understand why these particular coefficients work 
              for imitating this function (as Jeff in vignette was asking), let's look at one other function 
              (<m>f\left(x\right)=\sin\left(x\right)</m>) and imitate it using a built-in command on your CAS.  
              On most CAS, the <m>\mathbf{Taylor}</m> command has similar syntax.  On Maple, we use 
              <m>\mathbf{taylorpoly(sin(x), x=0, 7)}</m>; to get a seventh degree polynomial that mimics
              <m>f\left(x\right)=\sin\left(x\right)</m> near zero.  On a TI-Nspire CX CAS, the syntax is 
              <m>\mathbf{taylor(sin(x), x, 7, 0)}</m> where the 0 at the end is the point near where you want to 
              imitate the function and the <m>x</m> is the variable you would like used in the polynomial (if 
              you omit the value about which you want to imitate the function, it assumes a value of 0).  On the 
              TI-Nspire CX CAS you can find the <m>\mathbf{Taylor}</m> command under the <m>\mathbf{Series}</m> 
              submenu of the <m>\mathbf{Calculus}</m> menu.
            </p>

              Now in order to understand why these particular polynomials work, let's examine the 
              9th degree polynomial that you have found.  As you learned in Calculus 1, we can infer information 
              about the “shape” of a graph by looking at the derivative.  More specific, the first derivative 
              tells us the slope of the function at a given point, the second derivative tells us the rate at 
              which the slope is changing, the third derivative tells us the rate at which the rate of the slope 
              is changing and so on.  With each higher order derivative, we gain more information about the 
              “shape” of the graph and its behavior.  This is the idea behind Taylor polynomials.

              are basic algorithms that exist as routines in any computer or calculator (note that exponents can 
              be accomplished using repeated multiplication).  If we wish to know <m>\sin\left(0.7\right)</m>, 
              the machine can simply create a finite polynomial that imitates the sine function to the desired 
              decimal accuracy and then compute it using these basic binary operations that make up the polynomial.

      Many who begin a teacher preparation program often have a misconception that since they have experienced 
      mathematical content as a learner, teaching it simply consists of telling students what you have already 
      learned yourself.  As I was preparing to be a teacher, this was also my naïve position.  When I first 
      started to prepare lessons and act them out with my peers, I soon realized that I had not really 
      internalized the mathematics deeply enough to respond to interesting questions posed by my fellow 
      pre-service teachers.  But I would just dismiss it at first by justifying it as, "these are my peers, so 
      that's not such a big deal.  I am going to teach high school students, not my peers who were already in 
      undergraduate courses with me".  However, observing both in field placements and videos of actual classrooms, 
      I saw high school students asking really interesting questions for which I had no reasonable response.  
      In my field placements, typically the teacher would skirt the issue and tell the student to just follow 
      the steps they had been shown leaving the students frustrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      As time went on, I began to realize that the reason the teacher avoided these questions was because, 
      like me, they did not fully grasp the mathematics that they were teaching.  This expereince motivated me 
      to try to do more than memorize the procedures I was being taught, but rather to connect ideas.  This 
      actually helped me to reduce what I needed to commit to memory since I could retrieve information better 
      once it was connected to other concepts.  For this reason, we should now reflect on our mathematical 
      experience and connect it to your earlier responses to Jeff's question in the classroom scenario.

  <title>Complex Connections: Applications to the Classroom</title>

  <p>
      One of the important skills as a teacher is the ability to take specific curriculum and modify or add to 
      it to make connections for your students.  In this section, we will spend some time examining the 
      structure of a specific set of curriculum materials and reflect on how you might make classroom decisions 
      to take advantage of connected mathematics content in light of your own understanding of the mathematics 
      you learned as an undergraduate.  In this case we will use the secondary curriculum <em>Contemporary 
        Mathematics in Context: A Unified Approach (Core-Plus)</em> as a springboard for discussion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recall the classroom situation presented in <xref ref="subsec-prelim-complex-connections"/>.  There, Jan 
    had been teaching polynomials and factoring out of Lesson 2 of the <em>Contemporary Mathematics in Context: 
    A Unified Approach (Core-Plus)</em> curriculum and she assigned homework related to the use of polynomials 
    for imitating functions such as <m>f\left(x\right)=\sin\left(x\right)</m>.  Your task here is to explore 
    Lesson 2 from Unit 6, Polynomials and Factoring, as well as Lesson 4 from Unit 7, and explain how making 
    appropriate pedagogical decisions could help connect the topics involved.
  </p>

  <p>
    <activity>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Read through the Lesson 2 from Unit 6 of the <em>Contemporary Mathematics in Context: A Unified 
            Approach (Core-Plus)</em> curriculum, book 4B (pp. 382-405).  You will notice that the lesson is 
            broken up into three investigations (<em>Need for Speed</em>, <em>Strategic Factors</em>, and 
            <em>A Complex Solution)</em>.

            The overall purpose of the lesson seems to center around the idea of using polynomials in various 
            forms to model situations and even imitate more complicated functions such as 
            <m>f\left(x\right)=\sin\left(x\right)</m>.  Discuss in your groups why you think the investigation,

            As you will recall from the discussion in <xref ref="act-coreplus-impersonate-jan-class"/>, Jeff 
            had asked a question regarding the origin of the polynomials that were being used to imitate the 
            function <m>f\left(x\right)=\sin\left(x\right)</m>.  Also note that this occurred within Lesson 2 
            of Unit 6.  In addition, this particular lesson also sees the first time complex numbers are 
            introduced within the <em>Core Plus</em> curriculum.  Now that you have examined the entire lesson 
            from this unit, explain any connections that you see between complex numbers and the use of 
            polynomials to imitate the sine function.

    Many teachers (and the general population for that matter) often think that the text book they use "is" the 
    curriculum.  It is important to realize that this is not the case.  For example, we have already explored 
    the <em>Common Core State Standards</em> which is the document for many states (like Michigan) that define 
    the curriculum.  Local school districts can expand on these standards as well giving teachers more detail 
    for what is to be covered.  However, the text itself, is not the curriculum, but rather a tool for delivering 
    the curriculum much like other tools such as graphing calculators or computer software are tools.  One of the 
    tasks of a teacher is to take a curriculum that is being used and help their students connect ideas 
    even if the curriculum does not explicitly do it.
  </p>

  <p>
    <activity>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Read through Lesson 4 from Unit 7 of the <em>Contemporary Mathematics in Context: A Unified Approach 
          (Core-Plus)</em> curriculum, book 4B (pp. 494-507).  In this lesson, the concepts surrounding 
          complex numbers are expanded from their earlier introduction in Lesson 2 of Unit 6.  In particular, 
          the trigonometric form of complex numbers, <m>r\left(\cos\theta +i\sin\theta\right)</m>, is discussed.  
          In question 3 of the “Reflecting” section (p. 504), Euler's formula, 
          <m>e^{i\theta}=\cos\theta +i\sin\theta</m>, is stated and the students are expected to evaluate 
          expressions using it; however, there is no treatment of the origin of Euler's formula.  As a teacher, 
          your job is to help students make connections between their earlier experiences in Unit 6 and their 
          current experiences in Unit 7.

        <p>
          In addition, consider the following dialogue from Jan's earlier classroom situation where she is 
          has taught (Lesson 2, Unit 6) is now teaching the content from Lesson 4 of Unit 7.  She had assigned 
          the questions from the “Reflecting” section of Lesson 4 (pp. 504-505) as homework.  During the next 
          class session, the following discussion occurred.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jan</em>:	How did the homework go?  Does anyone have questions?
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <em>Dan</em>:	When I got to question 3, I wasn’t sure where that <m>e</m> to the <m>i</m> theta thing 
          came from?
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <em>Jan</em>:	Oh, that's just Euler's formula.  The mathematician Euler came up with that a long time 
          ago.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Dan</em>:	But I don't get where he got it.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Liz</em>:	I had the same sort of question.  Isn't <m>e</m> a real number?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jan</em>:	Yes, it is.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Liz</em>:	Then how can you raise a real number to a power and get a number that's not real?  That 
          doesn't make sense.  Didn't we say that if you multiply any two real numbers together, we get another 
          real number?  Like isn't <m>e^2</m> real?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jan</em>:	Yes, <m>e^2</m> is real.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Liz</em>:	But if powers are just repeated multiplication, then why wouldn't <m>e</m> to any power 
          be real?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Dan</em>:	Yeah, I couldn't figure that out either.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jan</em>:	But the power in <m>e^{i\theta}</m> is not real.  So it can end up having an imaginary 
          part.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Ken</em>:	But where did Euler get this thing?  How did he figure out that 
          <m>e^{i\theta}=\cos\theta +i\sin\theta</m>?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jan</em>:	Well you'll just have to take my word for it right now.  Euler used mathematics that you 
          can't understand yet.  You'll need to wait until you take more math before you can start to understand 
          that.

        Now that we have established how Taylor series can be used to impersonate other more complicated 
        functions, we can look at connections to complex numbers and try to address Ken's question from Jan's 
        classroom exchange.  The authors of the Core-Plus curriculum are counting on these connections and their 
        materials reflect this thoughtful design.  One of the goals of integrated curricula like Core-Plus or 
        IMP is to impart to the students that mathematics is not simply a collection of procedures to be 
        memorized and performed, but rather a linked web of ideas and concepts that make sense when we look at 
        them from a holistic perspective.  To this end, we now examine how ideas from calculus, algebra, and 
        geometry come together to give a more solid picture of complex numbers.

        <introduction>
          <p>
            At the end of the classroom exchange from Jan's lesson, Ken asked the very understandable question, 
            "But where did Euler get this thing?  How did he figure out that 
            <m>e^{i\theta}=\cos\theta +i\sin\theta</m>?".  However, Jan's response of, "Well you'll just have to 
            take my word for it right now.  Euler used mathematics that you can't understand yet." may not be 
            entirely accurate.  In this activity we explore how the use of Taylor polynomials can help Ken 
            explore a surprising connection between trigonometry and the complex number systems.  During the next

              transcendental functions, <m>e^x</m>, <m>\sin\left(x\right)</m>, and <m>\cos\left(x\right)</m> by 
              using the polynomials:
              <me>
                e^x=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}+\frac{x^6}{6!}+\cdots
              </me>
              <me>
                \sin\left(x\right)=x-\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^7}{7!}+\cdots
              </me>
              <me>
                \cos\left(x\right)=1-\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}-\frac{x^6}{6!}+\cdots
              </me>
            </p>
            <p>
              At this point, you may have noticed similarities among the three polynomial expansions that imitate 
              the three transcendental functions: <m>e^x</m>, <m>\sin\left(x\right)</m>, and 
              <m>\cos\left(x\right)</m>.  Describe any connections you see among the terms for these polynomial 
              expansions.

              Using the first six terms for each of the polynomial expansions of <m>\cos\left(\theta\right)</m> 
              and <m>\sin\left(\theta\right)</m>, write out an expression for the approximation to 
              <m>\cos\left(\theta\right)+i\cdot\sin\left(\theta\right)</m>.

              Now using the substitution of <m>x=i\cdot\theta</m> in the polynomial expansion 
              <m>e^x=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}+\frac{x^6}{6!}+\cdots</m>, 
              write out the first twelve terms.  On the TI-Nspire CAS you can do this by simply using the "such that" key entering 
              <m>|x=i\cdot\theta</m> after the expression for the Taylor polynomial you found for <m>e^x</m>.  
              Describe any patterns you see among the three polynomial expansions for <m>e^x</m>, 
              <m>\sin\left(x\right)</m>, and <m>\cos\left(x\right)</m>.  Did this substitution help remedy any 
              differences you noticed in part (a)?  Explain.
            </p>

            <p>
              Notice that the result you found in part (c) is a number that has both a real and an imaginary 
              part.  The terms that are similar to the polynomial for sine have the imaginary number <m>i</m> 
              attached by multiplication.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this case we think of a complex number of the form <m>a+bi</m> as a point in the complex plane 
              where the real part is plotted along the horizontal axis and the imaginary part is plotted along 
              the vertical axis.  As in the case of the relationship between rectangular and polar coordinates, 
              we can also think of the same point defined by the rectangular form <m>a+bi</m> as also defined by 
              an angle and a radius.  For example, we can take the complex number 
              <m>\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i</m> and express it as the point in the complex plane located at 
              a distance of 1 from the origin and at an angle of <m>\frac{\pi}{3}</m> since 
              <m>\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i=\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)+i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)</m>.  
              Although these are both helpful ways to represent complex numbers, is there another way that is 
              even simpler?
            </p>

            <p>
              Now considering the fact that we can express any complex number <m>a+bi</m> in the polar form, 
              <m>r\left(\cos\left(\theta\right)+i\cdot\sin\left(\theta\right)\right)</m> as 
              you observed in part (c), what is the practical significance of your discovery?  We will now 
              investigate the relevance of this observation to basic operations on complex numbers.

    <title>Pulling Things Together: Basic Geometry</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Just as the Greeks were wary of numbers such as  <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, mathematicians were also cautious 
        when it came to the solutions of equations like  <m>x^2=-1</m>.  It did not seem conceivable to have a 
        number that when multiplied by itself could yield a negative number.  In fact, negative numbers 
        themselves were still suspect and even though Euler had shown that the product of two negatives was a 
        positive (see <xref ref="thm-product-two-negatives"/>), mathematicians were not quite ready to deal with 
        the interpretation of a negative number.  Nonetheless, as we noted before, when Cardano was able to come 
        up with <em>real</em> solutions to the general cubic equation, <m>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0</m>, by tiptoeing 
        through solutions to intermediate equations where <m>\sqrt{-1}</m> existed, interest grew in regard to this 
        weird number, <m>\sqrt{-1}</m>.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <p>
      Although the imaginary number <m>i=\sqrt{-1}</m> has become accepted and used to extend the real numbers, 
      <m>\mathbb{R}</m>, to the complex numbers, <m>\mathbb{C}</m>, how do we as mathematicians come to 
      understand this set?  Before we delve deeper into the ways in which the complex numbers help us connect 
      various branches of mathematics, let us first have a brief review of how complex numbers can be viewed and 
      the representations associated with their understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Summarizing what we have discussed thus far, you will recall that our numeration system has evolved from 
      the basic counting numbers, <m>\mathbb{Z}^+</m> to the whole numbers, 
      <m>\mathbb{Z}^+ \cup \left\{0\right\}</m>, to the integers, <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>, to the rational numbers,
      <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>, and finally the real numbers, <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.  As we have seen, 
      <m>\mathbb{Z}^+ \subset \mathbb{Z}^+ \cup \left\{0\right\} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset 
       \mathbb{R} </m>.  So how do the complex numbers fit into this scheme?  We would like to have an extension 
       of our real numbers so that  
       <m>\mathbb{Z}^+ \subset \mathbb{Z}^+ \cup \left\{0\right\} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset 
       \mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C}</m>.  In order to extend the real numbers, if we allow the imaginary numbers 
       to simply augment the real numbers by adding on an imaginary part to a real number such as <m>a+bi</m> 
       where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are real numbers, then we can reduce the complex numbers to real numbers by 
       simply using the special case where <m>b=0</m> to generate the real numbers.  Therefore we obtain the 
       following definition.
    </p>

    <p>
      <definition xml:id="def-complex-numbers">
        <statement>
          <p>
            The <em>complex numbers</em> are the set of all numbers of the form <m>a+bi</m> where <m>a</m> and 
            <m>b</m> are real numbers and <m>i=\sqrt{-1}</m>.  Note that if <m>b=0</m>, we have the set of 
            <em>real</em> numbers and so <m>\mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C}</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that we have a definition, how do we make sense of these numbers?  Until the complex numbers came 
      along, all was fine.  We could think of the whole numbers as the cardinality of sets of objects.  When 
      negative numbers came on the scene, we could understand them through a process of “taking away” from sets 
      of objects.  As we progressed to rational and irrational numbers, we invoked a measurement model (the 
      number line) to describe all of the previous types of numbers.  But how then do we interpret complex 
      numbers?
    </p>

    <p>
      If we take a closer look at the various parts of a complex number, we can gain some insight into how to 
      represent them.  Since a complex number, <m>a+bi</m>, is made up of “coefficients” <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> 
      that are real numbers, why not use the model that has worked for real numbers, the number line?  The only 
      problem is that we now have two real numbers associated with a given complex number.  So which one do we 
      use?  The solution is to use both.  Why not think of a complex number as an ordered pair of real numbers.  
      This would imply that we can plot a complex number in a coordinate plane using <m>\mathbf{1}</m> as the 
      <m>\mathbf{real}</m> <m>\mathbf{unit}</m> along one axis and <m>\mathbf{i}</m> as the 
      <m>\mathbf{imaginary}</m> <m>\mathbf{unit}</m> along the other axis since <m>a+bi=a\cdot 1+b\cdot i</m>.  
      As a result, we can think of a complex number, <m>a+bi</m>, as a point in the plane.
    </p>

    <p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-complex-plane-intro">
        <caption>Perpendicular "Number Lines" for Describing <m>a+bi</m></caption>
        <image source="images/complex-plane-intro.png" width="60%"/>
      </figure>
    </p>

    <p>
      One advantage to this representation is that when we consider the real numbers as a subset of 
      <m>\mathbb{C}</m> by setting <m>b=0</m>, from a graphical perspective, the plane is reduced to the real 
      line and thus we have a consistent representation for the real numbers using a measurement model.  In 
      addition, from a linear algebra perspective, we can also view complex numbers as <em>vectors</em> and 
      thus the vector space, <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>, can be thought of as isomorphic to <m>\mathbb{C}</m> and 
      <m>\mathbb{R}</m> as a <em>subspace</em> of <m>\mathbb{C}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we can think of the complex numbers as a plane, can we have different representations of these numbers 
      from an algebraic standpoint?  As you may recall from high school, we can graph points with real 
      coordinates in either a Cartesian or polar form.  Just as we can define a point by two numbers representing 
      a position along the <m>x-</m> and <m>y-</m>axes, we can also define the same point by an angle, 
      <m>\theta</m>, and a radius, <m>r</m>.  To illustrate this, consider the unit circle in 
      <xref ref="fig-complex-plane-angle"/>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-complex-plane-angle">
        <caption>Complex Plane with <m>a+bi</m> Defined by Angle and Distance</caption>
        <image source="images/complex-plane-angle.png" width="60%"/>
      </figure>
    </p>

    <p>
      The position of the point in the complex plane along the unit circle can be described by the angle and 
      radius (in this case <m>r=1</m>).  If we wish to see the relationship between the Cartesian and polar 
      representations, we simply use the trigonometric relations to see that <m>a=\cos \theta</m> and 
      <m>b=\sin\theta</m> (see <xref ref="fig-complex-plane-unit"/>).
    </p>

    <p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-complex-plane-unit">
        <caption>Complex Number on the Unit Circle</caption>
        <image source="images/complex-plane-unit.png" width="60%"/>
      </figure>
    </p>

    <p>
      If the complex number is not confined to the unit circle, we can represent it by multiplying 
      <m>\cos\left(\theta\right)+i\sin\left(\theta\right)</m> by the radius, <m>r</m>, yielding 
      <m>r \left(\cos\left(\theta\right)+i\sin\left(\theta\right)\right)</m>.  In this way we can describe any 
      point in the complex plane as in <xref ref="fig-complex-plane-angle"/>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we extend our number system representing them as points in a plane, concepts like absolute value 
      become more interesting.  How do we interpret the concept of absolute value for complex numbers?  One of 
      the beautiful things about mathematics is its logical consistency.  When it comes to absolute value, 
      we should expect nothing less.  Recall that our concept of absolute value for real numbers is linked to a 
      relationship of distance on the real number line.  For the real numbers, <m>\left|x\right|</m> is just 
      the distance of <m>x</m> from 0 on the number line.  Why not adopt a similar concept for the absolute 
      value of a complex number.  In this case, instead of the position of 0 on a line, we invoke the analogous 
      point for a plane.  Therefore we define the absolute value or <em>modulus</em> of a complex number, 
      <m>z</m>, as the distance of <m>z</m> from the origin of the complex plane, denoted by <m>\left|z\right|</m>.  
    </p>

    <p>
      If we think of <m>z=a+bi</m>, then 
      <m>\left|z\right|=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}=\sqrt{\left(\text{Re}\left(z\right)\right)^2+\left(\text{Im}\left(z\right)\right)^2}</m> 
      by the Pythagorean theorem where <m>\text{Re}\left(z\right)</m> and <m>\text{Im}\left(z\right)</m> 
      represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.  We often refer to the complex numbers that 
      lie on the unit circle in the complex plane as the set, <m>U</m>.  Therefore  
      <m>U=\left\{z \in \mathbb{C} \mid \left|z\right|=1\right\}</m>.  The angle, <m>\theta</m>, of the vector for 
      <m>z</m> is called the <em>principal angle</em> or sometimes the <em>principal argument</em> of <m>z</m> 
      and expressed as <m>\text{Arg}\left(z\right)</m>.  We will explore this set of complex numbers later when we 
      look at orbits of complex numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our next question is how do we compute with complex numbers?  Is our definition of these numbers 
      consistent with or geometric view of complex numbers as being represented by points in a plane?  For 
      addition, <m>\left(a_1+b_1i\right)+\left(a_2+b_2i\right)=\left(a_1+a_2\right)+\left(b_1+b_2\right)i</m> 
      due to commutativity and the distributive property.  How does this play out geometrically?  Consider the 
      addition of two vectors in the complex plane.
    </p>

    <p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-complex-plane-two-vectors">
        <caption>Two Vectors in the Complex Plane</caption>
        <image source="images/complex-plane-two-vectors.png" width="60%"/>
      </figure>
    </p>

    <p>
      Adding these vectors geometrically, we get
    </p>

    <p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-complex-plane-two-vectors-added">
        <caption>Adding Two Vectors in the Complex Plane</caption>
        <image source="images/complex-plane-two-vectors-added.png" width="60%"/>
      </figure>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since we add vectors <em>head-to-toe</em>, the geometric representation is consistent with the algebraic 
      representation through standard vector addition.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now we can turn our attention to multiplication.  Again, using the basic commutative and distributive 
      properties, we would suspect that
      <me>
        z_1 \cdot z_2=\left(a_1+b_1i \right)\left(a_2+b_2i \right)=a_1a_2+a_1b_2i+a_2b_1i+b_1b_2i^2
      </me>
      and since <m>i^2=-1</m>, we get
      <me>
        z_1 \cdot z_2=\left(a_1a_2-b_1b_2\right)+\left(a_1b_2+a_2b_1\right)i
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      What geometric properties can we expect from this consequence and how do they fit with our earlier 
      observations?  To explore the geometric interpretation of this product, let us consider the polar forms of 
      these complex numbers where
    </p>
    <p>
      <me>
        a_1=r_1\cos\left(\theta_1\right)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      <me>
        b_1=r_1\sin\left(\theta_1\right)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      <me>
        a_2=r_2\cos\left(\theta_2\right)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      <me>
        b_2=r_2\sin\left(\theta_2\right)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      With this in mind, making the appropriate substitutions we get
    </p>
    <p>
      <me>
        z_1 \cdot z_2=\left(r_1r_2\cos\left(\theta_1\right)\cos\left(\theta_2\right)-
        r_1r_2\sin\left(\theta_1\right)\sin\left(\theta_2\right)\right)+
        \left(r_1r_2\cos\left(\theta_1\right)\sin\left(\theta_2\right)+
        r_1r_2\cos\left(\theta_2\right)\sin\left(\theta_1\right)\right)i
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Noticing that the product <m>r_1r_2</m> appears in each term we can simplify this to
    </p>

    <p>
      <me>
        z_1 \cdot z_2=r_1r_2\left[\left(\cos\left(\theta_1\right)\cos\left(\theta_2\right)-

      This tells us that the product in some way involves the product of the two moduli, <m>r_1</m> and 
      <m>r_2</m>.  But how are the angles of the original complex numbers and the resulting angle of the product 
      related?  Consider the two components of the product,
      <m>\cos\left(\theta_1\right)\cos\left(\theta_2\right)-
      \sin\left(\theta_1\right)\sin\left(\theta_2\right)</m> and 
      <m>\cos\left(\theta_1\right)\sin\left(\theta_2\right)+
        \cos\left(\theta_2\right)\sin\left(\theta_1\right)</m>.  Do these look familiar?  If not, open your old 
        Calculus or Trigonometry text and investigate.  From our basic trigonometric identities, we see that

    <p>
      <me>
      \cos\left(\theta_1+\theta_2\right)=\cos\left(\theta_1\right)\cos\left(\theta_2\right)-
      \sin\left(\theta_1\right)\sin\left(\theta_2\right)

      and

        \sin\left(\theta_1+\theta_2\right)=\cos\left(\theta_1\right)\sin\left(\theta_2\right)+
        \cos\left(\theta_2\right)\sin\left(\theta_1\right)
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Using these identities, we get
    </p>

    <p>
      <me>
        z_1 \cdot z_2=r_1r_2\left[\left(\underbrace{\left(\cos\left(\theta_1\right)\cos\left(\theta_2\right)-
        \sin\left(\theta_1\right)\sin\left(\theta_2\right)\right)}_{\cos\left(\theta_1+\theta_2\right)}\right)+
        \left(\underbrace{\cos\left(\theta_1\right)\sin\left(\theta_2\right)+

    <p>
      Thus, the modulus of the product of two complex numbers is the product of the moduli for the original two 
      numbers and the argument of the product is the sum of the arguments.  In other words,

      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Or in other words, if <m>\theta_3</m> is the angle of the product, <m>z_3</m>, then

    <title>Seeing Connections: Taylor Series</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        As we have seen through the use of trigonometric identities, finding the product of two complex numbers 
        expressed in polar form is simply a matter of multiplying the moduli and adding the arguments and then 
        using the cosine and sine of the new arguments.  But is there an easier way to represent complex numbers 
        so that the need to find trigonometric values of the arguments is not necessary?  At this point, we will 
        examine what you discovered in the activity, <em>A Complex Situation</em> 
        (<xref ref="act-complex-situation"/>), and apply it to work with complex numbers.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <p>
      You may recall from Calculus that when we wish to model exponential growth mathematicians and scientists 
      often use functions of the form, <m>Ae^{kt}</m> even though our first experiences with such phenomena 
      usually involve the concept of doubling.  For example, as teachers, we often introduce exponential growth 
      through examples like:
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>A population of ducks doubles every 13 years.  If the population of ducks currently numbers 45, 
      how many ducks would you expect in the population in 26 years?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Using this type of example to introduce exponential growth, one might expect to model the growth using a 
      function of the form <m>A2^{kt}</m> rather than <m>Ae^{kt}</m>.  It is not until we begin the study of 
      Calculus that we can grasp the reason for using <m>Ae^{kt}</m>.  Recall that 
      <m>\frac{d}{dx}\left(a^x\right)=a^x \ln \left(a\right)</m> and so for the special case where <m>a=e</m>, 
      this derivative simplifies to <m>\frac{d}{dx}\left(e^x\right)=e^x</m>.  Therefore it is advantageous to 
      use the natural base, <m>e</m>, instead of a base like 2.  In a similar manner, we find <m>e</m> creeping 
      back into the representation of complex numbers as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider the result you found in <xref ref="act-complex-situation"/>, <em>A Complex Situation</em>.  
      In particular, consider the relationship
    </p>

    <p>
      <me>
        r \underbrace{\sum^{\infty}_{k=0} \frac{\left(i \theta \right)^k}{k!}}_{e^{i \theta}}=r
        \left(\underbrace{\sum^{\infty}_{k=0} \left(-1\right)^k \frac{\left(\theta \right)^{2k}}
        {\left(2k\right)!}}_{\cos \left(\theta\right)}+i \cdot \underbrace{\sum^{\infty}_{k=0} 
        \left(-1\right)^k \frac{\left(\theta \right)^{2k+1}}{\left(2k+1\right)!}}_
        {\sin \left(\theta\right)}\right)
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      This suggests that any complex number can be expressed in the form <m>re^{i \theta}</m>.  We should 
      take a moment to mention that a treatment of the convergence of complex series is necessary here, but 
      for the time being we will assume these series converge.  Thus if we consider any two complex numbers 
      <m>z_1=r_1e^{i \theta_1}</m> and <m>z_2=r_2e^{i \theta_2}</m>, then the product is given by
    </p>

    <p>
      <me>
        z_1 \cdot z_2=\left(r_1e^{i \theta_1}\right) \cdot \left(r_2e^{i \theta_2}\right)
        =r_1r_2e^{i \theta_1+ i \theta_2}=r_1r_2e^{i\left(\theta_1+ \theta_2\right)}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      yielding the same conclusion found using trigonometry.  In this case, results from Calculus find an 
      interesting way of influencing the representations we might choose to use for complex numbers.  If you 
      have ever asked yourself why a high school teacher needs to take so much mathematics beyond what is 
      taught in the high school, this is one example of how understanding the relationships among various areas 
      of mathematics might influence pedagogical choices made in the classroom.

    <title>Orbits of Complex Numbers</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Just like the real numbers, the complex numbers have a structure that allows for the solution of 
        equations by using basic properties.  We will expand on these later when we address the concept of 
        a <em>group</em> within the context of abstract algebra, but for now it suffices to say that just like 
        the real numbers under multiplication, there exists an <em>identity element</em> that when 
        multiplied by any number leaves it alone.  For example, consider <m>5 \cdot 1=1 \cdot 5=5</m>.  Here the 
        number 1 is acting as the identity element.  When it comes to solving equations, this is an important 
        idea since if we can get the coefficient of a variable to be 1, we can basically ignore it.  Consider 
        the equation, <m>5x=15</m>.  If we can only find a way to make the coefficient of <m>x</m> a 1, it 
        for all practical purposes can be ignored the variable is then alone on one side of the equation leaving 
        us able to simply read off the solution.  But how can we "make" the coefficient a 1?  We can't just 
        change it.  Well, the key is to exploit a relationship between an <em>identity element</em> and an 
        <em>inverse element</em>.  Basically, an <em>inverse</em> is an element (or number in this case) that when 
        combined with a number using the operation (multiplication in this case) yields the <em>identity</em>.  
        In the case of our equation, <m>5x=15</m>, we need a number that when multiplied by 5 gives 1.  The 
        number, <m>\frac{1}{5}</m>, works here as <m>\frac{1}{5}</m> is the <em>multiplicative inverse</em> of 
        <m>5</m>.  
      </p>

      <p>
        The use of this relationship between identities and inverses is the key to solving many problems 
        including puzzles like Rubik's Cube and thus permeates all of mathematics.  For our <m>5x=15</m> 
        example, we simply multiply by <m>\frac{1}{5}</m> on the left on both sides of the equation and we get 
        <me>
          \frac{1}{5} \cdot 5x=\frac{1}{5} \cdot 15 \Rightarrow 1 \cdot x=3 \Rightarrow x=3
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        The next natural question is if complex numbers have the same relationships?  In the following activity, 
        we will explore these properties with complex numbers by looking at <em>orbits</em> of complex numbers.

      Now consider the complex number, 
      <m>z=\frac{1}{2}\left(\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{3} \right) +i\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{3} \right) \right)=
        \frac{1}{2}e^{i \frac{\pi}{3}}</m>.  Here the successive powers yield a different kind of spiral.

      Why does one of these produce an outwardly spiraling pattern while the other produces an inward spiral?  
      Consider the consequences of <xref ref="thm-powers-complex-numbers"/>.  As we go from one power to the 
      next, the point in the complex plane rotates by the initial angle (in this case, 
      <m>\theta =\frac{\pi}{3}</m>).  In addition, the modulus becomes successive powers of the original 
      modulus.  In the case of  <m>r=\sqrt{2}</m> which is greater than 1, the sequence of the successive modulus 
      will increase without bound.  In the case of <m>r=\frac{1}{2}</m> which is less than 1, the sequence of 
      successive modulus decreases and converges to 0.  What would happen if the original complex number 
      appeared on the unit circle?  You explored this question in <xref ref="act-orbits-complex-numbers"/>.  
      Because of this spiraling pattern, this sequence of powers of a complex number is called the orbit of the 
      complex number.

            Let <m>z \in \mathbb{C}</m>.  The set 
            <m>\mathbf{Orb}\left(z\right)=\left \{z^n \mid z \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \right \}</m> is called the

      One of the applications of orbits of complex numbers is in determining roots.  For example, suppose we 
      want to find all of the 7th roots for the complex number, <m>z=-2+2i</m>.  We can also express this as 
      <m>z=\sqrt{8}\left(\cos \left(\frac{3\pi}{4} \right) +i\sin \left(\frac{3\pi}{4} \right) \right)</m> 
      since <m>r=\sqrt{\left(-2\right)^2+2^2}=\sqrt{8}</m>.  If we consider a 7th root of <m>z</m>, call it 
      <m>z_r</m>, to have the property that 
      <m>\left(z_r\right)^7=\sqrt{8}\left(\cos \left(\frac{3\pi}{4} \right) +i\sin \left(\frac{3\pi}{4} \right) \right)</m>, 
      then we know that its modulus must end up being <m>\sqrt{8}</m>.  By 
      <xref ref="thm-powers-complex-numbers"/>, this means that the modulus of <m>z_r</m> must be 
      <m>\left(\sqrt{8}\right)^{\frac{1}{7}}</m> and <m>z_r</m> must have rotated six times to arrive at the 
      <m>\mathbf{Arg}\left(z\right)</m>.  In other words, we need

        7 \theta_r=\frac{3\pi}{4} \text{ and thus } \theta_r=\frac{3\pi}{28}

    </p>

      However, this is not the only equation that will do what we wish.  Since we are dealing with periodic 
      functions, we could equally solve the equation

    <p>
      <me>
        7 \theta_r=\frac{3\pi}{4}+2\pi k \text{ yielding } \theta_r=\frac{3\pi}{28}+\frac{2 \pi k}{7}

      The geometric relationship here can be seen by examining the orbits for these solutions.  Consider the 
      following orbits for <m>k=\left \{0,1,2,3\right \}</m> shown below.  These graphs utilize a polar 
      graphing mode defining 
      <m>z\left(k\right)=8^{\frac{1}{14}}\left(\cos \left(\frac{3\pi}{28}+\frac{2 \pi k}{7} \right) 
        +i\sin \left(\frac{3\pi}{28}+\frac{2 \pi k}{7} \right) \right)</m> and graphing the x-coordinate as 
        <m>real\left(z\left(k\right)^t\right)</m> and y-coordinate as <m>imag \left(z\left(k\right)^t\right)</m> 
        for <m>k=\left \{0,1,2,3\right \}</m> and <m>t=\left \{0,1,2,\ldots, 7\right \}</m>.  They also use a 
        connected line to show the progression from one power to the next.  The geometric representation for 
        each value of <m>k</m> shows the rotation about the origin by the same angle for successive powers and 
        an elongation of the modulus finally ending at the complex number, <m>-2+2i</m> when raised to the 7th 
        power.  Since the angle that is being used for the rotation is of the form 
        <m>\theta_r=\frac{3\pi}{28}+\frac{2 \pi k}{7}</m>, you will notice that as <m>k</m> increases, the 
        size of the angle rotation between successive powers also increases.
