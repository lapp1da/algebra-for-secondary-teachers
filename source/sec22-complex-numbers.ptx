  <title>Extending the Number System: Complex Numbers</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Throughout history, our number system has evolved primarily driven by necessity.  It should come as no 
      surprise that our current system (the complex numbers) was also driven by an issue with the real number 
      system.  On of the motivators was the search for real solutions to equations, in particular, polynomial 
      equations.  The solution to the general quadratic equation, <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m>, had beeen established as 
      <me>
        x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
      </me>
      but there was still some concern for the situation when a negative appeared under the radical.  Putting 
      these negative square roots aside, the usefulness of the real solutions found with the quadratic 
      formula was considered a leap forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1494, Luca Picioli published is volume, <em>Summa de Arithmetica</em>, where he examined linear and 
      quadratic equations.  However, there was still a search for a solution to the general cubic, 
      <m>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0</m>.  At the time, the solution to some forms of the cubic had been found.  For 
      example, Scipione del Ferro had found a way to solve the "depressed" cubic (meaning one without the squared 
      term) of the form, <m>x^3+mx=n</m>, but the general cubic was still out of reach and Picioli did not have 
      high hopes that a solution to the general cubic could be found.  In his work, Picioli began to 
      experiment with more symbolic notation using the symbol, <em>co</em>, to denote a variable (here <em>co</em>
      was short for <em>cosa</em>, Italian for "thing" or "thing to be found"), and was a leap forward in 
      compressing notation so that ideas could be expressed in a smaller visual space reducing the number of 
      words used in formalizing mathematical arguments.  We will address the importance of compressed expressions 
      with respect to Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno's (2008) model for the development of symbolic meaning later, 
      but for now, it suffices to say, mathematics was on the verge of significant advancement.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Scipione del Ferro had kept his discovery for finding a solution to <m>x^3+mx=n</m> a secret as was often the 
      practice of the time, since academic appointments were not very secure and mathematicians could be 
      "dethroned" from their positions by being challenged.  Upon his death, he passed his solution to his student, 
      Antonio Fior.  Now Fior was not nearly as good of a mathematician as del Ferro, but was a bit more brash.  
      Fior began challenging mathematicians since he knew all he had to do was give them depressed cubics that 
      only he alone knew how to solve and he would be the victor.  As fate would have it, Fior chose to 
      challenge the Brescian scholar, Niccolo Fontana.  Now Fontana was a brilliant mathematician, but was 
      disfigured by the sword of a French soldier as a child and his deformity caused him to speak with a 
      stammer.  He was therefore more commonly known by the cruel epithet, Tartaglia (The Stammerer).  Well, 
      Tartaglia began to attack Fior's challenge of 30 depressed cubics, but had not made much progress.  As the 
      time to submit his final solutions approached, on February 13, 1535, he had a breakthrough and discovered 
      the solution to the depressed cubic, <m>x^3+mx=n</m>, defeating his challenger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that Tartaglia had mastered the depressed cubic, another brilliant mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano, 
      sought an audience with Tartaglia in hopes of learning the solution to the depressed cubic.  Tartaglia 
      refused to reveal his secret, but after many other attempts at persuasion, Tartaglia finally relented with 
      the caveat that Cardano would not reveal or publish the solution.  Cardano gladly accepted the terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Enter the young 20-year-old mathematician, Ludovico Ferrari.  Ferrari approached Cardano asking for work and 
      they soon forged a partnership.  With their collaboration, Cardano found a way to depress the general 
      cubic, <m>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0</m>, into one of the form, <m>x^3+mx=n</m>.  However, Cardano's dilemma was 
      that in order to publish his solution to the general cubic, he would then need to use Tartaglia's solution 
      for the depressed cubic and he had vowed not to reveal it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stymied by his moral dilemma, in 1543, Cardano and Ferrari went to Bologna to explore the works of 
      del Ferro.  To their surprise, they found that del Ferro had actually written down his original solution 
      to the depressed cubic, prior to Tartaglia discovering it.  Since he could now state that he got the 
      solution to the depressed cubic from del Ferro and not Tartaglia, Cardano was now free to publish the 
      solution to the general cubic.  When his work, <em>Ars Magna</em> was published, it was earth shattering 
      news to the mathematical community.
    </p>

    <p>
      So now you are wondering, how is this historical trip relevant to complex numbers?  As it turns out, using 
      Cardano's process for finding solutions to the general cubic, at stages of the process, the pesky number, 
      <m>\sqrt{-1}</m>, shows up.  However, when continuing the process, we can have the <m>\sqrt{-1}</m> 
      resolved by squaring and thus obtain <em>real</em> solutions in the end.  So in order to obtain 
      real solutions to the general cubic, mathematicians had to "tip-toe" through the imaginary, 
      <m>i=\sqrt{-1}</m>, and this was uncomfortable.  With the quadratic formula, we could just ignore the 
      messy <m>\sqrt{-1}</m> since those solutions weren't real anyway, but here, we have to put up with 
      <m>\sqrt{-1}</m> to arrive at real solutions.  Mathematicians could no longer simply turn a blind eye, 
      but had to face that such numbers must exist.

    <title>Complex Numbers and the Common Core State Standards</title>
    <p>
      The secondary school curriculum includes the teaching of complex numbers even though some aspects of this 
      are not required for all students graduating from high school.  Note that the Common Core State 
      Standards denote this with a (+) symbol next to those topics not expected for all students.  However, 
      all secondary teachers must be expected to teach these concepts and certainly any student planning to 
      enter scientific fields should be expected to leave high school having exerpience with complex numbers.  
      Below in <xref ref="fig-ccss-complex-numbers"/> are the standards from the CCSS with regard to complex 
      numbers.

      One of the important skills as a teacher is the ability to take specific curriculum and modify or add to 
      it to make connections for your students.  In this section, we will spend some time examining the 
      structure of a specific set of curriculum materials and reflect on how you might make classroom decisions 
      to take advantage of connected mathematics content in light of your own understanding of the mathematics 
      you learned as an undergraduate.  In this case we will use the secondary curriculum <em>Contemporary 
        Mathematics in Context: A Unified Approach (Core-Plus)</em> as a springboard for discussion.
    </p>

    <p>
      “When will I ever teach this?”  You most likely have uttered this statement while taking undergraduate 
      mathematics courses as part of your teacher preparation program.  The purpose of this section is to 
      highlight examples of where the secondary mathematics curriculum and the undergraduate mathematics 
      curriculum are inextricably connected.  To begin this discussion, we may want to brush up on some 
      mathematical ideas on which a teacher tasked with teaching complex numbers may rely.  The Core-Plus 
      curriculum is counting on connections and is designed to take advantage of a variety of mathematical 
      concepts as the complex number system is explored.

            To start, examine the <em>On Your Own</em> problem at the end of <em>Investigation 1</em>, from the 
            fourth year text of <em>Contemporary Mathematics in Context: A Unified Approach</em> found on page 
            385 of book 4B.  It is restated below for your convenience in

          Now that you have started to reflect on the mathematics and pedagogy present in these explorations, 
          consider the following classroom situation where a teacher (Jan) is questioned by her students.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jan has been teaching polynomials and factoring out of Lesson 2 of the <em>Contemporary Mathematics in 
            Context: A Unified Approach (Core-Plus)</em> curriculum.  She assigned students to work on the 
            “On Your Own” question found on page 385 of book 4B as well as the “Extending” questions found on 
            pages 402-403 (see <xref ref="fig-core-plus-on-your-own-1"/> and 
            <xref ref="fig-core-plus-on-your-own-2"/>).  During the next class period, she facilitated a 
            discussion of the homework assignment.  Within the discussion, Jeff asked, “I was able to do the 
            error function graphs and I understand that the longer the polynomial, the closer we get to matching 
            the sine function, but how did they come up with those polynomial functions?  They all have weird 
            coefficients and stuff.”

              Explain how you would respond to Jeff's question.  Keep in mind that Jeff is in his fourth year 
              of high school mathematics and has been exposed to the concept of derivative earlier in book 4A.

      Depdending on when you are taking this course, you may or may not have completed Calculus 2.  In order to 
      have productive conversations about this classroom scenario, we should take a moment to either examine or 
      brush up on some content from Calculus 2.  In this next activity, we will revisit some of these main 
      concepts, so if you have already been exposed to an activity such as this, please don't spoil it for

        <title>Impersonating Functions</title>
        
        <introduction>
          <p>
            This activity explores basic concepts of algebra and calculus involved in using power series to 
            imitate transcendental functions.  In particular, the series for <m>\sin\left(x\right)</m>,
            <m>\cos\left(x\right)</m>, and <m>e^x</m> are investigated and connections are made with practical 
            uses of such functions for creating computing algorithms used by calculators and computers to 
            evaluate numerical approximations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Have you ever wondered how your calculator knows what the <m>\ln\left(5\right)</m> or the 
            <m>\sin\left(0.7\right)</m> is or how it can find decimals for numbers like <m>\sqrt{3}</m>?  Did 
            someone program every possible square root, trig value, or logarithm into the machine?  Wouldn't 
            that take up a tremendous amount of memory?  Well, the answer is that your calculator knows how to 
            use basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to approximate these 
            types of values to the desired decimal accuracy.  In this exploration you will first investigate how 
            we can approximate more complicated transcendental functions using simple polynomials.  Once we 
            establish this method for approximating functions with polynomials, we will then use it to explore 
            a surprising connection between trigonometry and the complex number systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            To this point we have seen that if we zoom in far enough, a function looks a great deal like a 
            straight line.  But how does this help us impersonate more complicated functions like <m>e^x</m>?
          </p>

              Graph <m>y=e^x</m> along with several possible linear functions that would look like the 
              “linear-looking” graph of <m>y=e^x</m> when you zoom in near <m>x=0</m>.  Remember, you need the 
              linear function to have the same slope as <m>y=e^x</m> and also have the same point in common 
              with <m>y=e^x</m> at zero.  Record the lines you tried along with brief explanations for why you 
              tried those particular lines.  Give your final line that you feel best imitates <m>y=e^x</m> at 
              <m>x=0</m>.

            <p>
              Now that you have created a line that looks similar to <m>y=e^x</m> near <m>x=0</m>, graph it 
              along with <m>y=e^x</m> on the same window.  Zoom out and give an approximation of the interval 
              about <m>x=0</m> where your line is a “fairly close” imitation of <m>y=e^x</m>.

            <p>
              Suppose you want to imitate <m>y=e^x</m> within a larger interval.  Since <m>y=e^x</m> is not 
              linear, we need a function that curves so that it will “hug” the graph of <m>y=e^x</m> through a 
              larger interval.  Since quadratics are curved, experiment with your linear function from part (a) 
              by adding on a term of the form <m>ax^2</m>.  Record your choices for <m>a</m> along with sketches 
              of your new quadratic function and <m>y=e^x</m> on the same axes.  Give your final choice of 
              quadratic function of the form <m>ax^2+bx+c</m> that best imitates <m>y=e^x</m> near <m>x=0</m>.

              You have now been able to extend the size of the interval where <m>y=e^x</m> can be imitated by a 
              polynomial by adding on a higher degree polynomial term.  Can this continue?  Take the quadratic 
              function you have developed in part (c) and try to extend the interval of imitation further by 
              adding on a third-degree term and experimenting with its coefficient. Give your final choice of 
              cubic function of the form <m>ax^3+bx^2+cx+d</m> that best imitates <m>y=e^x</m> near <m>x=0</m> 
              and sketch your graph of <m>y=e^x</m> along with your cubic.

          <statement>
            <p>
              The polynomials you have created to imitate the function <m>y=e^x</m> are called Taylor polynomials 
              named for the mathematician, Brook Taylor.  To understand why these particular coefficients work 
              for imitating this function (as Jeff in vignette was asking), let's look at one other function 
              (<m>f\left(x\right)=\sin\left(x\right)</m>) and imitate it using a built-in command on your CAS.  
              On most CAS, the <m>\mathbf{Taylor}</m> command has similar syntax.  On Maple, we use 
              <m>\mathbf{taylorpoly(sin(x), x=0, 7)}</m>; to get a seventh degree polynomial that mimics
              <m>f\left(x\right)=\sin\left(x\right)</m> near zero.  On a TI-Nspire CX CAS, the syntax is 
              <m>\mathbf{taylor(sin(x), x, 7, 0)}</m> where the 0 at the end is the point near where you want to 
              imitate the function and the <m>x</m> is the variable you would like used in the polynomial (if 
              you omit the value about which you want to imitate the function, it assumes a value of 0).  On the 
              TI-Nspire CX CAS you can find the <m>\mathbf{Taylor}</m> command under the <m>\mathbf{Series}</m> 
              submenu of the <m>\mathbf{Calculus}</m> menu.
