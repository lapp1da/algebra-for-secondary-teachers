  <title>Algebraic Structure</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      To many, algebra is jokingly referred to as the advanced study of the last three letters of the alphabet.  But 
      what is it really?  The answer might be different to different people (even mathematicians who study advanced 
      topics).  If we look at commonalities among varying people's perspectives, we will likely see that algebra 
      deals with the <em>relationships</em> among quantities or mathematical objects.  We see an underlying structure 
      whether we are dealing with numbers, or matrices, or functions, or geometric movements on objects, or, ....  In 
      this chapter we will look at this structure and try to understand why Poincaré said:

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>Mathematicians do not study objects, but relations among objects; they are indifferent to the 
          replacement of objects by others as long as relations do not change. Matter is not important, only form 
          interests them. — Henri Poincaré</em>.
