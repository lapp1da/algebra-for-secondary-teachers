  <title>Elementary Concepts of Number</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    Throughout mathematics, humankind has found the need to expand its numeration systems.  While some cultures 
    developed symbol systems to represent the concept of number, others relied (and still rely on) linguistic 
    representations.  For example, some studies suggest that the Pirah√£ tribe in Brazil have a limited 
    system consisting of just "one", "two", and "many".  Scholars are still debating this tribe's concept 
    of number, but one might ask, why only three words for numbers?  As we examine the concept of number, it is 
    important to realize that <em>number</em> is usually tied to a culture.  Imagine a culture where people 
    possess very few things.  If there is no need to keep track of possessions, why invent a number 
    representation to express them?  If very few people have more than two of anything and there is no need to 
    compare quantities, why bother?  "Many" should suffice.  Throughout history, we will see that the 
    expansion of a number system is usually triggered by a necessity for describing amounts or quantities.

    One of the earliest numeration systems was the tally system or what we like to call the WYSIWYG 
    (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) system.  In this system, simple tally marks represented a number.  For 
    example, suppose you had seven bags of grain.  In the tally system, the person would represent their 
    possessions as |||||||.  As you can imagine, this would be fine if you had little, but if you had many 
    possessions, it would quickly become cumbersome.  The Egyptians developed a way of eliminating the need for 
    tally marks by inventing new symbols to represent groups of objects.  In this case, the Egyptians grouped by 
    ten (probably due to the fact that people had ten fingers and when counting on fingers, to keep track, they 
    would need to begin again on the first hand after counting to ten).  Once they collected ten of something, 
    the created a new symbol to represent a bundle of ten.  Once ten of those bundles were gathered, they created 
    another symbol to represent ten bundles of ten and so on (see <xref ref="fig-egyptian-numerals"/>).  This 
    way, to write a numeral, they would never need to have any more than nine of any symbol.  They used the 
    following symbols to represent various powers of ten.

  </p>

  <p>
    With each different symbol, the Egyptians could now write larger numbers using a more condensed collection 
    of symbols than in a tally system.  For example, suppose we wish to express the number 31,254.  In our 
    Hindu-Arabic system, we allow each space to represent a different power of the base (ten in this case).  
    Thus, <m>31,254=3\cdot 10^4+1\cdot 10^3+2\cdot 10^2+5\cdot 10^1 +4</m> expressed in expanded base-ten 
    notation.  The Egyptians, on the other hand, did not use the spatial location of the symbols to convey the 
    specific power of the base, but rather they created a different symbol for each power (size bundle).  
    Therefore, the number 31,254 would be written as

  </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    Although this system was a great improvement over the tally system of numeration, it doesn't take long to 
    see a major drawback.  Since each new power of the base requires a new symbol, expressing larger and larger 
    numbers becomes cumbersome.  In order to express any given positive integer, the Egyptian system requires 
    an infinite number of symbols.

    So how do we improve on the problem of needing to create new symbols for each power of ten (or any base for 
    that matter)?  The ancient Babylonians developed a <em>place-value</em> system for representing any positive 
    integer using a finite number of symbols.  The Babylonians used the position of the symbol or collection of 
    symbols to represent the power of the base (in this case a base sixty system which meant that in any single 
    position, the symbols could total at most fifty-nine).  Although they bundled in groups of sixty, they had 
    only two symbols along with a place holder to be used for when there were no bundles of a certain power of 
    the base (see <xref ref="fig-babylonian-symbols" />).  The early Babylonians did not use the place holder, but the confusion caused by not being able 
    to indicated easily when there were no bundles of a certain size necessitated the creation of a symbol to 
    "hold an open space".  The Babylonians did not have a fully functioning zero, but the place holder provided 
    a way to indicate no bundles of a specific size by its location in the string of symbols.

    To illustrate, consider the expanded base sixty notation as written using our familiar Hindu-Arabic numerals.  
    Here we have <m>39,605=11\cdot 60^2+0\cdot 60 +5</m>.  And so the early Babylonians would write this number as
  </p>

  <p>
    <image source="images/babylonian-example-noplaceholder.png" width="25%" />
  </p>

  <p>
    The problem was in how this numeral could be interpreted.  Did this collection of symbols mean 
    <m>11\cdot 60+5=655</m> or <m>11\cdot 60^2+0\cdot 60+5=39,605</m>?
  </p>

  <p>
    To make this expression less ambiguous, the placeholder was used to express the meaning more clearly.  Thus 
    the later Babylonian system would write the intended number as
  </p>

  <p>
    <image source="images/babylonian-example-placeholder.png" width="30%" />
  </p>

  <p>
    As we shared before, although the use of the placeholder serves the same role as our zero in the Hindu-Arabic 
    system, the Babylonians did not recognize the concept of zero as being a number representing nothing.
