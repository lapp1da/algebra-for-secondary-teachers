  <title>Elementary Concepts of Number</title>

  <p>
    Throughout mathematics, humankind has found the need to expand its numeration systems.  One of the earliest 
    numeration systems was the tally system or what we like to call the WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) 
    system.  In this system, simple tally marks represented a number.  For example, suppose you had seven bags 
    of grain.  In the tally system, the person would represent their possessions as |||||||.  As you can imagine, 
    this would be fine if you had little, but if you had many possessions, it would quickly become cumbersome.  
    The Egyptians developed a way of eliminating the need for tally marks by inventing new symbols to represent 
    groups of objects.  In this case, the Egyptians grouped by ten (probably due to the fact that people had 
    ten fingers and when counting on fingers, to keep track, they would need to begin again on the first hand 
    after counting to ten).  Once they collected ten of something, the created a new symbol to represent a bundle 
    of ten.  Once ten of those bundles were gathered, they created another symbol to represent ten bundles of 
    ten and so on.  This way, to write a numeral, they would never need to have any more than nine of any symbol.  
    They used the following symbols to represent various powers of ten.

    With each different symbol, the Egyptians could now write larger numbers using a more condensed collection 
    of symbols than in a tally system.  For example, suppose we wish to express the number 31,254.  In our 
    Hindu-Arabic system, we allow each space to represent a different power of the base (ten in this case).  
    Thus, <m>31,254=3\cdot 10^4+1\cdot 10^3+2\cdot 10^2+5\cdot 10^1 +4</m> expressed in expanded base-ten 
    notation.  The Egyptians, on the other hand, did not use the spatial location of the symbols to convey the 
    specific power of the base, but rather they created a different symbol for each power (size bundle).  
    Therefore, the number 31,254 would be written as
