  <title>Elementary Concepts of Number</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    Throughout mathematics, humankind has found the need to expand its numeration systems.  While some cultures 
    developed symbol systems to represent the concept of number, others relied (and still rely on) linguistic 
    representations.  For example, some studies suggest that the Pirah√£ tribe in Brazil have a limited 
    system consisting of just "one", "two", and "many".  Scholars are still debating this tribe's concept 
    of number, but one might ask, why only three words for numbers?  As we examine the concept of number, it is 
    important to realize that <em>number</em> is usually tied to a culture.  Imagine a culture where people 
    possess very few things.  If there is no need to keep track of possessions, why invent a number 
    representation to express them?  If very few people have more than two of anything and there is no need to 
    compare quantities, why bother?  "Many" should suffice.  Throughout history, we will see that the 
    expansion of a number system is usually triggered by a necessity for describing amounts or quantities.

  <p>
    One of the earliest numeration systems was the tally system or what we like to call the WYSIWYG 
    (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) system.  In this system, simple tally marks represented a number.  For 
    example, suppose you had seven bags of grain.  In the tally system, the person would represent their 
    possessions as |||||||.  As you can imagine, this would be fine if you had little, but if you had many 
    possessions, it would quickly become cumbersome.  The Egyptians developed a way of eliminating the need for 
    tally marks by inventing new symbols to represent groups of objects.  In this case, the Egyptians grouped by 
    ten (probably due to the fact that people had ten fingers and when counting on fingers, to keep track, they 
    would need to begin again on the first hand after counting to ten).  Once they collected ten of something, 
    they created a new symbol to represent a bundle of ten.  Once ten of those bundles were gathered, they created 
    another symbol to represent ten bundles of ten and so on (see <xref ref="fig-egyptian-numerals"/>).  This 
    way, to write a numeral, they would never need to have any more than nine of any symbol.  They used the 
    following symbols to represent various powers of ten.

  </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    With each different symbol, the Egyptians could now write larger numbers using a more condensed collection 
    of symbols than in a tally system.  For example, suppose we wish to express the number 31,254.  In our 
    Hindu-Arabic system, we allow each space to represent a different power of the base (ten in this case).  
    Thus, <m>31,254=3\cdot 10^4+1\cdot 10^3+2\cdot 10^2+5\cdot 10^1 +4</m> expressed in expanded base-ten 
    notation.  The Egyptians, on the other hand, did not use the spatial location of the symbols to convey the 
    specific power of the base, but rather they created a different symbol for each power (size bundle).  
    Therefore, the number 31,254 would be written as

  </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    Although this system was a great improvement over the tally system of numeration, it doesn't take long to 
    see a major drawback.  Since each new power of the base requires a new symbol, expressing larger and larger 
    numbers becomes cumbersome.  In order to express any given positive integer, the Egyptian system requires 
    an infinite number of symbols.

    So how do we improve on the problem of needing to create new symbols for each power of ten (or any base for 
    that matter)?  The ancient Babylonians developed a <em>place-value</em> system for representing any positive 
    integer using a finite number of symbols.  The Babylonians used the position of the symbol or collection of 
    symbols to represent the power of the base (in this case a base sixty system which meant that in any single 
    position, the symbols could total at most fifty-nine).  Although they bundled in groups of sixty, they had 
    only two symbols along with a place holder to be used for when there were no bundles of a certain power of 
    the base (see <xref ref="fig-babylonian-symbols" />).  The early Babylonians did not use the place holder, but the confusion caused by not being able 
    to indicated easily when there were no bundles of a certain size necessitated the creation of a symbol to 
    "hold an open space".  The Babylonians did not have a fully functioning zero, but the place holder provided 
    a way to indicate no bundles of a specific size by its location in the string of symbols.

  </p>

  <p>
    To illustrate, consider the expanded base sixty notation as written using our familiar Hindu-Arabic numerals.  
    Here we have <m>39,605=11\cdot 60^2+0\cdot 60 +5</m>.  And so the early Babylonians would write this number as
  </p>

  <p>
    <image source="images/babylonian-example-noplaceholder.png" width="25%" />
  </p>

  <p>
    The problem was in how this numeral could be interpreted.  Did this collection of symbols mean 
    <m>11\cdot 60+5=655</m> or <m>11\cdot 60^2+0\cdot 60+5=39,605</m>?
  </p>

  <p>
    To make this expression less ambiguous, the placeholder was used to express the meaning more clearly.  Thus 
    the later Babylonian system would write the intended number as
  </p>

  <p>
    <image source="images/babylonian-example-placeholder.png" width="30%" />
  </p>

  <p>
    As we shared before, although the use of the placeholder serves the same role as our zero in the Hindu-Arabic 
    system, the Babylonians did not recognize the concept of zero as being a number representing nothing.

    The ancient Mayan civilization were probably the first to fully recognize the concept of zero.  The Mayans 
    also used a place-value numeration system.  In this case, their grouping number was twenty.  They actually 
    had a pseudo base twenty system since their place values progressed as: 
    <m>1, 20, 18\cdot 20, 18\cdot 20^2, 18\cdot 20^3, \ldots</m>.  The reason for the deviation from <m>20^2</m> 
    was due to their calendar that had 18 months with 20 days per month (<m>18\cdot 20=360</m>).  Like the 
    Babylonians, the Mayans had very few symbols.  The difference is that the Mayans had a symbol for zero 
    (or nothing) represented by an empty oyster shell.  This was different from the Babylonians in that the 
    Mayan's symbol was not just a placeholder, but rather was a symbol representing nothingness.  The symbols 
    are given below.
  </p>

  <p>
  <figure xml:id="fig-mayan-numerals">
    <caption>Mayan Numeration Symbols</caption>
    <image source="images/mayan-numerals.png" width="70%"/>
  </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    Like the Babylonians, the position of the collection of symbols determined the power of the base.  However, 
    unlike the Babylonians, the Mayan base is not exactly uniform.  Instead of a base twenty system, they used 
    a <em>pseudo-base twenty system</em>.  The reason for this is that the base was tied to their calendar year.  
    The Mayan calendar contained 18 months each containing 20 days.  The result was a 360-day year.  This can 
    be seen below by the replacement of the normal place value, <m>20^2</m>, with the place value of 
    <m>18\cdot 20</m>.  After this, the place values simply increase the power of 20 by one for each successive 
    place.  The Mayans wrote the numerals vertically with the higher powers of the base above the lower powers 
    and the symbol for zero was used as a placeholder.  For example, the number 
    <m>21,717=3\cdot 18\cdot 20^2+0\cdot 18\cdot 20+5\cdot 20+17</m>, in Hindu-Arabic would be written as
  </p>

  <p>
    <image source="images/mayan-example.png" width="30%" />
  </p>

  <p>
    To this point, civilizations had focused mainly on representing the natural or counting numbers,  
    <m>\mathbb{N}=\left\{1,2,3,4,\ldots\right\}</m>.  The Mayans extended this system to include zero 
    <m>\left\{0,1,2,3,4,\ldots\right\}</m>, often referred to as the <em>whole numbers</em>.  Some texts 
    include 0 in the set of natural numbers and refer to the counting numbers as the positive integers, denoted 
    <m>\mathbb{Z}^+</m>.  Thus, the use of <m>\mathbb{Z}^+</m> seems to be less ambiguous since zero is neither 
    positive nor negative and so we will use <m>\mathbb{Z}^+=\left\{1,2,3,4,\ldots\right\}</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the advancement of a place-value system, cultures evolved to use different symbols for each 
    <em>face value</em> (i.e. the symbols used to represent the number of any particular sized bundle).  These 
    symbols were dependent on the base (or bundle size) that was used.  For example, in our current commonly 
    used base system, (base ten), we have ten symbols since once we get ten of anything, we bundle them and we 
    create another bundle of the next place value space.  For base six, there would be six symbols.  For base, 
    there would be three symbols, and so on.  Therefore, in base ten, we have the symbols 
    0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  The symbols used here are the <em>Hindu-Arabic</em> numerals (not to be 
    confused with Arabic numerals) used on many Middle Eastern countries 
    (see <xref ref="fig-arabic-v-hindu-arabic-numerals" />).  
    Both use a base-ten place-value system.
  </p>

  <p>

    <caption>Arabic vs Hindu-Arabic Numerals</caption>
    <image source="images/arabic-v-hindu-arabic.png" width="70%"/>
  </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    An interesting fact is that even though Arabic is written right-to-left, the numerals are still written 
    left-to-right.  This is due to the fact that the symbols were adopted from India where language is written 
    left-to-right.  This means that while reading text, you would read right-to-left until reaching a numeral 
    and then switch to left-to-right for the number and then switch back to right-to-left as you continue to 
    read the text.  Again, this shows how mathematics and language are both culturally connected.  Below 
    (<xref ref="fig-arabic-license-plate" />) is a picture of a license plate from Iraq from 2025. This would 
    be read as 656874 in our Hindu-Arabic symbols.  Iraq was in the process to switching to the use of the 
    Western Hindu-Arabic numerals at the time and this is an older plate that had not yet been replaced.

          In this activity, we will explore how different bundling sizes impact the way numerals are used to

          the number "twenty-three".  Notice that we use the English term "twenty-three" here since the number 
          "twenty-three" will look different as a collection of numerals or digits depending on how we decide

    As time went on, the need arose to represent the concept of debt.  Since people had created the whole 
    numbers, people again chose to extend the current number system to accommodate the need to represent 
    quantities that were the "opposite" of the positive integers.  Thus, the accepted set of numbers became 
    the <em>integers</em>, denoted <m>\mathbb{Z}=\left\{\ldots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\ldots\right\}</m>.

    Eventually, there was a need to represent quantities that were smaller than a whole unit 
    (for a fun cartoon see <xref ref="weird-number" /> below) and so the rational numbers again extended the known set of numbers.  
    To the Greeks, all quantities could be expressed as the quotient of two integers and so the rational numbers, 
    denoted <m>\mathbb{Q}=\left\{\frac{a}{b} \mid a,b\in \mathbb{Z} \right\}</m>, came to be the accepted system 
    of numbers.
