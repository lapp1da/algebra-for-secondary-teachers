      <title>Abby's Lesson on Scientific Notation</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Abby is teaching scientific notation as part of her 8th grade curriculum.  You can see the details 
          from the Common Core State Standards <em>8.EE #4</em> as given in 
          <xref ref="fig-ccss-scientific-notation" />.  She begins by discussing the process for converting back and 
          forth between numbers written in standard Hindu-Arabic form and those written in scientific notation.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Abby</em> : Today we are going to look at another way to write numbers when they become so long that 
          we really don't need to use all of their digits.  When a number gets so big, the digits closest to the 
          units really don't matter so much.  Suppose you are Elon Musk and you decide to buy a new jet.  The 
          jet costs $200,000,000.  Further suppose Mr. Musk is currently worth roughly $412 billion.  After 
          the purchase of the jet, how much is Elon Musk worth?  Yes, Kate.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Kate</em> : $411.8 billion?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Abby</em> : Good, but let's just keep it in whole billions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Kate</em> : OK, $412 billion?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Abby</em> : Nice!  So did his purchase really matter much when it come to his wealth?  Toby?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Toby</em> : Not at all.  That's like me worrying about fifty cents.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Abby</em> : So what we are going to talk about today is called scientific notation and it's used 
          when numbers are so big that we don't really need to worry about all the digits.  Suppose we are 
          looking at the number 372400.  Instead of writing all of the digits, we can instead write it as a 
          power of 10.  If move the decimal point to the left until it is between the 3 and the 7 and count 
          how many places we move it [<em>Abby writes the number placing the decimal point at the far right 
          and then draws curved half circles under the digits to indicate movement of the decimal point from 
          place to place, counting as she goes</em>], we can use the number of places we move it as the power 
          of 10.  This means that <m>372400=3.724 \times 10^5</m>.  So you just need to count the moves.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Mia</em> : Why are the moves the same as the power of 10?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Abby</em> : That's just how we write the new notation to shorten it.  Let's try another example 
          for a really big number.  That might help.  How would you write 5,681,000,000,000 in scientific 
          notation?  Yeah, Ja'miya.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Ja'miya</em> : Well, I guess we'd just count to get it between the 5 and 6, so let's see, one, 
          two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.  So twelve.  So would it be 
          <m>5.681 \times 10^{12}</m>?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Abby</em> : Great.  Does that help, Mia?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Mia</em> : Not really.  I'm still not sure why the power of ten is the same as counting the moves.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Abby</em> : Well, let's just practice a few more and see if that helps.
        </p>
        <p>

            scientific notation connected?

  <p>
    As you may have noticed in the vignette, Mia became frustrated because her question about why the process 
    Abby was describing worked was being ignored.  In order to teach mathematics, we much have a deeper 
    understanding of mathematical concepts so that we do not resort to procedural approaches to teaching out of 
    our own lack of understanding.  To this end, let's dive a little deeper into numeration and number systems 
    and explore why we write numerals as we do.
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout mathematics, humankind has found the need to expand its numeration systems.  While some cultures 
    developed symbol systems to represent the concept of number, others relied (and still rely on) linguistic 
    representations.  For example, some studies suggest that the Pirahã tribe in Brazil have a limited 
    system consisting of just "one", "two", and "many".  Scholars are still debating this tribe's concept 
    of number, but one might ask, why only three words for numbers?  As we examine the concept of number, it is 
    important to realize that <em>number</em> is usually tied to a culture.  Imagine a culture where people 
    possess very few things.  If there is no need to keep track of possessions, why invent a number 
    representation to express them?  If very few people have more than two of anything and there is no need to 
    compare quantities, why bother?  "Many" should suffice.  Throughout history, we will see that the 
    expansion of a number system is usually triggered by a necessity for describing amounts or quantities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another distinction we need to make is the difference between a <em>number</em> and a <em>numeral</em>.  In 
    society, these words are often used interchangeably, but they have quite different meanings.  A number is a 
    concept or property.  For example, the fingers on my hand have a property of "fiveness".  If I count them, I 
    can place them in a one-to-one correspondence with the words {one, two, three, four, five}.  Both of these 
    sets share a property of "fiveness".  Any other set that can be placed into a one-to-one correspondence 
    with these sets (fingers or words) can be said to have the property of "fiveness" and thus we say that 
    there are "five" things in the set.  Here five is a number concept.  In contrast, "5" is a symbol that we 
    use to represent the concept of five.  I guess, the word "five" is also a symbol (or collection of symbols) 
    that we use to represent the concept of five.  This is the distinction between number and numeral.  A number 
    is a concept while a numeral is a symbol that is used to denote the concept.  This will become a more 
    important distinction later when we look at how we develop symbolic meaning in an algebraic sense.

  <title>Elementary Whole Number Systems</title>
  

  <p>
    One of the earliest numeration systems was the tally system or what we like to call the WYSIWYG 
    (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) system.  In this system, simple tally marks represented a number.  For 
    example, suppose you had seven bags of grain.  In the tally system, the person would represent their 
    possessions as |||||||.  As you can imagine, this would be fine if you had little, but if you had many 
    possessions, it would quickly become cumbersome.  The Egyptians developed a way of eliminating the need for 
    tally marks by inventing new symbols to represent groups of objects.  In this case, the Egyptians grouped by 
    ten (probably due to the fact that people had ten fingers and when counting on fingers, to keep track, they 
    would need to begin again on the first hand after counting to ten).  Once they collected ten of something, 
    they created a new symbol to represent a bundle of ten.  Once ten of those bundles were gathered, they created 
    another symbol to represent ten bundles of ten and so on (see <xref ref="fig-egyptian-numerals"/>).  This 
    way, to write a numeral, they would never need to have any more than nine of any symbol.  They used the 
    following symbols to represent various powers of ten.
  </p>

  <p>
  <figure xml:id="fig-egyptian-numerals">
    <caption>Egyptian Numeral System</caption>
    <image source="images/egyptian-numerals.png" width="90%"/>
  </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    With each different symbol, the Egyptians could now write larger numbers using a more condensed collection 
    of symbols than in a tally system.  For example, suppose we wish to express the number 31,254.  In our 
    Hindu-Arabic system, we allow each space to represent a different power of the base (ten in this case).  
    Thus, <m>31,254=3\cdot 10^4+1\cdot 10^3+2\cdot 10^2+5\cdot 10^1 +4</m> expressed in expanded base-ten 
    notation.  The Egyptians, on the other hand, did not use the spatial location of the symbols to convey the 
    specific power of the base, but rather they created a different symbol for each power (size bundle).  
    Therefore, the number 31,254 would be written as
  </p>

    <caption>Egyptian Numeral for 31,254</caption>
    <image source="images/egyptian-numeral-example.png" width="60%"/>
  </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    Although this system was a great improvement over the tally system of numeration, it doesn't take long to 
    see a major drawback.  Since each new power of the base requires a new symbol, expressing larger and larger 
    numbers becomes cumbersome.  In order to express any given positive integer, the Egyptian system requires 
    an infinite number of symbols.

    So how do we improve on the problem of needing to create new symbols for each power of ten (or any base for 
    that matter)?  The ancient Babylonians developed a <em>place-value</em> system for representing any positive 
    integer using a finite number of symbols.  The Babylonians used the position of the symbol or collection of 
    symbols to represent the power of the base (in this case a base sixty system which meant that in any single 
    position, the symbols could total at most fifty-nine).  Although they bundled in groups of sixty, they had 
    only two symbols along with a place holder to be used for when there were no bundles of a certain power of 
    the base (see <xref ref="fig-babylonian-symbols" />).  The early Babylonians did not use the place holder, but the confusion caused by not being able 
    to indicated easily when there were no bundles of a certain size necessitated the creation of a symbol to 
    "hold an open space".  The Babylonians did not have a fully functioning zero, but the place holder provided 
    a way to indicate no bundles of a specific size by its location in the string of symbols.
  </p>

    <caption>Babylonian Numeration Symbols</caption>
    <image source="images/babylonian-symbols.png" width="70%"/>
  </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    To illustrate, consider the expanded base sixty notation as written using our familiar Hindu-Arabic numerals.  
    Here we have <m>39,605=11\cdot 60^2+0\cdot 60 +5</m>.  And so the early Babylonians would write this number as
  </p>

  <p>
    <image source="images/babylonian-example-noplaceholder.png" width="25%" />
  </p>

  <p>
    The problem was in how this numeral could be interpreted.  Did this collection of symbols mean 
    <m>11\cdot 60+5=655</m> or <m>11\cdot 60^2+0\cdot 60+5=39,605</m>?
  </p>

  <p>
    To make this expression less ambiguous, the placeholder was used to express the meaning more clearly.  Thus 
    the later Babylonian system would write the intended number as
  </p>

  <p>
    <image source="images/babylonian-example-placeholder.png" width="30%" />
  </p>

  <p>
    As we shared before, although the use of the placeholder serves the same role as our zero in the Hindu-Arabic 
    system, the Babylonians did not recognize the concept of zero as being a number representing nothing.

    The ancient Mayan civilization were probably the first to fully recognize the concept of zero.  The Mayans 
    also used a place-value numeration system.  In this case, their grouping number was twenty.  They actually 
    had a pseudo base twenty system since their place values progressed as: 
    <m>1, 20, 18\cdot 20, 18\cdot 20^2, 18\cdot 20^3, \ldots</m>.  The reason for the deviation from <m>20^2</m> 
    was due to their calendar that had 18 months with 20 days per month (<m>18\cdot 20=360</m>).  Like the 
    Babylonians, the Mayans had very few symbols.  The difference is that the Mayans had a symbol for zero 
    (or nothing) represented by an empty oyster shell.  This was different from the Babylonians in that the 
    Mayan's symbol was not just a placeholder, but rather was a symbol representing nothingness.  The symbols 
    are given below.
  </p>

  <p>
  <figure xml:id="fig-mayan-numerals">
    <caption>Mayan Numeration Symbols</caption>
    <image source="images/mayan-numerals.png" width="70%"/>
  </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    Like the Babylonians, the position of the collection of symbols determined the power of the base.  However, 
    unlike the Babylonians, the Mayan base is not exactly uniform.  Instead of a base twenty system, they used 
    a <em>pseudo-base twenty system</em>.  The reason for this is that the base was tied to their calendar year.  
    The Mayan calendar contained 18 months each containing 20 days.  The result was a 360-day year.  This can 
    be seen below by the replacement of the normal place value, <m>20^2</m>, with the place value of 
    <m>18\cdot 20</m>.  After this, the place values simply increase the power of 20 by one for each successive 
    place.  The Mayans wrote the numerals vertically with the higher powers of the base above the lower powers 
    and the symbol for zero was used as a placeholder.  For example, the number 
    <m>21,717=3\cdot 18\cdot 20^2+0\cdot 18\cdot 20+5\cdot 20+17</m>, in Hindu-Arabic would be written as
  </p>

  <p>
    <image source="images/mayan-example.png" width="30%" />
  </p>

  <p>
    To this point, civilizations had focused mainly on representing the natural or counting numbers,  
    <m>\mathbb{N}=\left\{1,2,3,4,\ldots\right\}</m>.  The Mayans extended this system to include zero 
    <m>\left\{0,1,2,3,4,\ldots\right\}</m>, often referred to as the <em>whole numbers</em>.  Some texts 
    include 0 in the set of natural numbers and refer to the counting numbers as the positive integers, denoted 
    <m>\mathbb{Z}^+</m>.  Thus, the use of <m>\mathbb{Z}^+</m> seems to be less ambiguous since zero is neither 
    positive nor negative and so we will use <m>\mathbb{Z}^+=\left\{1,2,3,4,\ldots\right\}</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the advancement of a place-value system, cultures evolved to use different symbols for each 
    <em>face value</em> (i.e. the symbols used to represent the number of any particular sized bundle).  These 
    symbols were dependent on the base (or bundle size) that was used.  For example, in our current commonly 
    used base system, (base ten), we have ten symbols since once we get ten of anything, we bundle them and we 
    create another bundle of the next place value space.  For base six, there would be six symbols.  For base, 
    there would be three symbols, and so on.  Therefore, in base ten, we have the symbols 
    0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  The symbols used here are the <em>Hindu-Arabic</em> numerals (not to be 
    confused with Arabic numerals) used on many Middle Eastern countries 
    (see <xref ref="fig-arabic-v-hindu-arabic-numerals" />).  
    Both use a base-ten place-value system.
  </p>

  <p>
  <figure xml:id="fig-arabic-v-hindu-arabic-numerals">
    <caption>Arabic vs Hindu-Arabic Numerals</caption>
    <image source="images/arabic-v-hindu-arabic.png" width="70%"/>
  </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    An interesting fact is that even though Arabic is written right-to-left, the numerals are still written 
    left-to-right.  This is due to the fact that the symbols were adopted from India where language is written 
    left-to-right.  This means that while reading text, you would read right-to-left until reaching a numeral 
    and then switch to left-to-right for the number and then switch back to right-to-left as you continue to 
    read the text.  Again, this shows how mathematics and language are both culturally connected.  Below 
    (<xref ref="fig-arabic-license-plate" />) is a picture of a license plate from Iraq from 2025. This would 
    be read as 656874 in our Hindu-Arabic symbols.  Iraq was in the process to switching to the use of the 
    Western Hindu-Arabic numerals at the time and this is an older plate that had not yet been replaced.

    Again, one of the reasons we do not want children to simply recognize a collection of symbols as representing 
    a single number is that it masks the meaning behind how our numeration system is expressed.  We must first 
    expect children from an early age to form bundles of varying sizes and count how many of each there are 
    before then translating this into symbols used to represent the number.  Jerome Bruner, the noted learning 
    theorist, suggested that children must go through three main phases in order to understand representations: 
    <em>Enactive</em>, <em>Iconic</em>, and finally <em>Symbolic</em>.  In the enactive stage, the students "do" 
    something to act out a process or concept.  The iconic stage consists of students producing images that are 
    raw representations of the process or concept.  These representations usually lead to limitations requiring a 
    refinement into more abstract symbolic representations.  By experiencing these stages in order, meaning is 
    attached to the symbols so that students can understand what they are symbolizing as opposed to just 
    memorizing without meaning.  Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno's (2008) model is an extension of this theory and we 
    will discuss their mechanisms for transition among these phases later when we look at algebraic concepts.  
    For now, we can see an example of an elementary teacher engaging Kindergartners in Bruner's theory in the 
    video in <xref ref="fig-video-kindergartners-place-value" />.

  <title>Extension of the Number System to Integers</title>

  <p>
    As time went on, the need arose to represent the concept of debt.  Since cultures had created the whole 
    numbers and a way to represent them, they again chose to extend the current number system to accommodate 
    the need to represent quantities that were the "opposite" of the positive integers.  Thus, the accepted 
    set of numbers became the <em>integers</em>, denoted 
    <m>\mathbb{Z}=\left\{\ldots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\ldots\right\}</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, operations on these negative numbers were still looked at with skepticism.  For example, what does 
    it mean to multiply two negative numbers?  Adding a negative to a positive had some meaning since the debt 
    model would mean that some of the positive value would be cancelled by the negative values.  Multiplying a 
    negative by a positive value also had some meaning since if we owe three people $10, then it makes sense 
    that <m>3 \cdot -10=-30</m>.  But what about multiplying two negative numbers?  Consider the video in 
    <xref ref="vid-integer-multiplication" />.

        <p>
          In the video in <xref ref="vid-integer-multiplication" />, we looked at a pile-and-hole model where 
          piles of sand represented positive values and holes represented negative values.  When a pile comes in 
          contact with a hole, we get level ground (i.e. zero).  In this activity, we will explore this idea 
          using two different colored chips (one color for positive and one color for negative).  Using these 
          chips, with blue as positive and red as negative, respond to the following questions.

            chip, this is equivalent to placing a pile into a hole.  Combine a blue chip with a red chip for as 
            many chips as you can.  If the red and blue combinations represent a filled hole (aka zero), what 
            is the numerical result of the remaining chips?  What addition problem does this represent?

            for as many chip that you can.  If the red and blue combinations represent a filled hole (aka zero), 
            what is the numerical result of the remaining chips?  What addition problem does this represent?
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            When we begin to examine multiplication, let's begin with "level" ground (i.e. zero).  With the sand 
            example, if we wanted to represent <m>3 \cdot -2</m>, we began with flot sand and "created" three 
            sets of two holes (the first number represents creating or placing and the second number represents 
            the object that we are creating or placing).  The result was that we had six holes meaning that the 
            result was <m>-6</m>.  For this question, with your chips, act out the multiplication 
            <m>5 \cdot -3</m>.  Explain the meaning of your result.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            With your chips, act out the multiplication <m>-2 \cdot 4</m>.  Remember that the first number 
            represents the act of creating or placing objects and so a negative value would need to represent 
            the act of removing objects.  Also, you need to begin with zero.  Explain the meaning of your result.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            To begin with zero and still have piles to "remove", what must you also have so that you begin with 
            a "flat" surface (i.e. zero)?

            the act of removing objects.  Also, you need to begin with zero.  Explain the meaning of your result.

    As convincing as our pile-and-hole model may seem from a physical manipulative perspective, it should not 
    seem too surprising that negative numbers had not been widely accepted for many years since reasoning by 
    analogy can give us insight, but it hardly constitutes abstract proof.  Mathematicians were still very 
    skeptical of negative numbers even in the 1700s (this is around the time of the founding of the USA).  
    This is really not that long ago.  In fact, in 1770 Euler used basic properties of the number system to 
    show the product of two negatives is positive.  His proof is really not that involved and can be followed 
    by most middle school students familiar with the properties of additive and multiplicative identities, 
    additive inverses (i.e. "opposites"), the distributive property of multiplication over addition, and the 
    zero product property (see <xref ref="thm-product-two-negatives" />).

          Consider that <m>\left(-1\right) \cdot \left(-1\right)=\left(-1\right) \cdot \left(-1\right)+0</m>, 
          since <m>0</m> is the additive identity.  This now leads to the fact that 
          <m>\left(-1\right) \cdot \left(-1\right)+0=\left(-1\right) \cdot \left(-1\right)+\left(-1\right)+1</m> 
          since <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m> are additive inverses.  But, 
          <m>\left(-1\right) \cdot \left(-1\right)+\left(-1\right)+1=
            \left(-1\right) \cdot \left(-1\right)+\left(-1\right) \cdot \left(1\right)+1</m> as <m>1</m> is the 
            multiplicative identity.  The distributive property now allows us to factor out <m>-1</m> from the 
            first two terms of this expression giving <m>\left(-1\right) \cdot \left[-1+1\right]+1</m>.  Since 
            <m>-1+1=0</m>, this leads to <m>\left(-1\right) \cdot \left[-1+1\right]+1=\left(-1\right) \cdot 0+1</m>.  
            Finally, since the product of any number and <m>0</m> is <m>0</m>, this shows that 
            <m>\left(-1\right) \cdot 0+1=0+1</m> and as <m>0</m> is the additive idenity, we get <m>0+1=1</m>.  
            Since this line of reasoning began with <m>\left(-1\right) \cdot \left(-1\right)</m>, we have shown that 
            <m>\left(-1\right) \cdot \left(-1\right)=1</m>.

  <title>Rational and Irrational Numbers</title>

    Eventually, there was a need to represent quantities that were smaller than a whole unit 
    (for a fun cartoon see <xref ref="weird-number" /> below) and so the rational numbers again extended the known set of numbers.  
    To the Greeks, all quantities could be expressed as the quotient of two integers and so the rational numbers, 
    denoted <m>\mathbb{Q}=\left\{\frac{a}{b} \mid a,b\in \mathbb{Z} \right\}</m>, came to be the accepted system 
    of numbers.

  <p>
    When Pythagoras' work suggested that the hypotenuse of a right isosceles triangle with legs of length 1 could 
    not be represented as the quotient of two integers (see <xref ref="fig-pythagorean-theorem-sqrt2" />) and 
    therefore, his work was considered heresy.  According to Pythagoras, if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the lengths 
    of the legs of a right triangle, then their relationship to the length, <m>c</m>, of the hypotenuse was, 
    <m>a^2+b^2=c^2</m>.  So if <m>a=b=1</m>, then this would say that 
    <m>c^2=1^2+1^2=1+1=2 \Rightarrow c=\sqrt{2}</m>.  However, <m>\sqrt{2}</m> would then need to be a rational 
    number if all numbers must be rational (according to the Greeks at the time).  The problem is that if we 
    make this assumption, we get a contradiction (see <xref ref="thm-sqrt2-irrational"/>).

    <theorem xml:id="thm-sqrt2-irrational">
      <title>
        Irrationality of <m>\sqrt{2}</m>
      </title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is not rational.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          (By contradiction)  Suppose <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is rational.  Then there exist <m>a,b \in \mathbb{Z}</m> 
          such that <m>\sqrt{2}=\frac{a}{b}</m> where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have no common divisors except 1 
          (i.e. <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> is in lowest terms).  Then <m>2=\frac{a^2}{b^2}</m> and thus <m>a^2=2b^2</m>.  
          Since <m>2 \vert a^2</m>, this implies <m>a^2</m> is even.  If <m>a^2</m> is even, then <m>a</m> must 
          also be even because if <m>a</m> were odd then <m>a^2</m> would be odd as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, let <m>a=2k</m> for some <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.  By substitution, 
          <m>\left(2k\right)^2=2b^2</m> and so <m>4k^2=2b^2</m>.  Dividing by 2 we get <m>2k^2=b^2</m> and thus 
          <m>b^2</m> is even (has 2 as a factor) and therefore <m>b</m> is also even.  But <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> 
          were assumed to have no common divisors except 1.  Since <m>2 \vert a</m> and <m>2 \vert b</m> we have 
          a contradiction and so <m>\sqrt{2}</m> must be irrational.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this proof can be replicated for <m>\sqrt{p}</m> for any prime, <m>p</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
      </theorem>
  </p>

  <p>
    Eventually, these irrational numbers such as <m>\sqrt{2}</m> became accepted by the mathematical community 
    and thus the current number system of the time was again extended to include both rational and irrational 
    numbers.  This set of numbers formed by the union both of these sets is called the <em>real numbers</em>, 
    denoted <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.  Other well-known irrational numbers include transcendentals such as 
    <m>\pi</m> and <m>e</m>.
