  <title>Concepts of Number and Quantity</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      The Common Core State Standards use the term <em>Number and Quantity</em> to describe concepts that are 
      associated with numerical concepts or other concepts related more abstract constructs like vectors and 
      matrices.  In this chapter, we will examine how these ideas develop in learners as well as how historically 
      they developed within the mathematical timeline.  We will begin by examining the most basic ideas of whole 
      numbers and then extend these sets of numbers as humankind found necessary to explain the natural world.
