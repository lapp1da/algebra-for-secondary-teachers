  <title>Dopplegangers and the Multiverse</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        In <xref ref="sec43-inverses-undoing-structure"/>, we noticed that there were common behaviors among 
        elements of groups.  For example, we noticed that the order of an element or subgroup must divide the order 
        of the group.  We explored a few groups in <xref ref="act-form-function"/> that demonstrated these 
        properties (one group was of order 6 and the other was or order 8).  But what if we had another group of 
        order 6?  Would it also have the exact same behavior with one element of order 1, three elements of order 2, 
        and two elements of order 3?  Could another group of order 6 be commutative where our previous on was not?  
        Or could we have a different configuration of these elements along with different behavior?  Also, recall 
        that as we have stated earlier, Poincaré said,

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>Mathematicians do not study objects, but relations among objects; they are indifferent to the 
        replacement of objects by others as long as relations do not change. Matter is not important, only form 
        interests them. — Henri Poincaré</em>.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Since in a finite group there are only a finite number of combinations of element orders, a natural question 
        is, can we have two different sets and operations act in the same way and will there only be so many groups 
        of a certain order before we start getting groups that repeat the behavior in terms of how the elements 
        interact with each other?  After all, Poincaré suggested that we do not care so much about what the sets of 
        objects are, just how that they interact with each other.  In this section, we will explore this idea of 
        behavior among different sets to see if we can infer behavior of one set of objects with an operation by 
        looking at a different set of objects with a possibly different operation.

      In order to explore our question of different groups and whether or not they can behave similarly, let us 
      first look at some examples of groups that can be generated and computed easily.
