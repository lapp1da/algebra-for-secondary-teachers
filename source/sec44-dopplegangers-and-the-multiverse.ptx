  <title>Dopplegangers and the Multiverse</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        In the last section, we noticed that there were common behaviors among elements of groups.  For example, 
        we noticed that the order of an element or subgroup must divide the order of the group.  We explored a few 
        groups in <xref ref="act-form-function"/> that demonstrated these properties (one group was of order 6 and the 
        other was or order 8).  But what if we had another group of order 6?  Would it also have the exact same behavior 
        with one element of order 1, three elements of order 2, and two elements of order 3?  Or could be have a 
        different configuration of these elements?
