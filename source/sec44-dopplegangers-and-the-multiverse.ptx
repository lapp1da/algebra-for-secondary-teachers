  <title>Dopplegangers and the Multiverse</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        In <xref ref="sec43-inverses-undoing-structure"/>, we noticed that there were common behaviors among 
        elements of groups.  For example, we noticed that the order of an element or subgroup must divide the order 
        of the group.  We explored a few groups in <xref ref="act-form-function"/> that demonstrated these 
        properties (one group was of order 6 and the other was or order 8).  But what if we had another group of 
        order 6?  Would it also have the exact same behavior with one element of order 1, three elements of order 2, 
        and two elements of order 3?  Could another group of order 6 be commutative where our previous on was not?  
        Or could we have a different configuration of these elements along with different behavior?  Also, recall 
        that as we have stated earlier, Poincaré said, 
    </p>
    <p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>Mathematicians do not study objects, but relations among objects; they are indifferent to the 
        replacement of objects by others as long as relations do not change. Matter is not important, only form 
        interests them. — Henri Poincaré</em>.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
        Since in a finite group there are only a finite number of combinations of element orders, a natural question 
        is, can we have two different sets and operations act in the same way and will there only be so many groups 
        of a certain order before we start getting groups that repeat the behavior in terms of how the elements 
        interact with each other?  After all, Poincaré suggested that we do not care so much about what the sets of 
        objects are, just how that they interact with each other.  In this section, we will explore this idea of 
        behavior among different sets to see if we can infer behavior of one set of objects with an operation by 
        looking at a different set of objects with a possibly different operation.

    <title>Modular Arithmetic and Groups</title>

    <p>
      In order to explore our question of different groups and whether or not they can behave similarly, let us 
      first look at some examples of groups that can be generated and computed easily.  In number theory, we 
      explore the behavior of the integers and, in particular, <em>modular arithmetic</em>.  <em>Modular 
      arithmetic</em> is built on the <em>division algorithm</em> as described below.
    </p>

    <p>
      <theorem xml:id="thm-division-algorithm">
        <title>The Division Algorithm</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>n</m> be any integer and <m>d</m> be a positive integer (d for divisor), then there exists 
            unique integers <m>q</m> (quotient) and <m>r</m> (remainder) such that
          </p>
          <me>n=dq+r \text{,  where } 0\leq r \lt d</me>.

        </statement>
      </theorem>
    </p>

    <p>
      While this theorem might look unfamiliar, if you think back to your days of doing long division, your will 
      likely recall continuing to perform the division process until your remainder was less than your divisor.  
      This is what the <em>Division Algorithm</em> is saying (i.e. <m>0\leq r \lt d</m>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Modular arithmetic is just a way of reducing all integers to a representative remainder that we get when we 
      divide the integer by a given divisor.  Consider the case of telling time.  We have two main ways we 
      represent time of day (military time and twelve-hour time).  Suppose we are given a time in military time, 
      say 14:00 hours.  What would that be in regular twelve-hour time?  <xref ref="fig-modular-12-hour-clock"/> 
      gives a twelve-hour clock where we can explore converting from military time to regular time.

        <introduction>
          <p>
            <p>
            In the military, a 24-hour clock is used to avoid the need for a.m and p.m. distinctions.  What we call 
            2:00 p.m. is referred to as 14:00 hours in the military.  In otherwords, 
            <m>14 \equiv 2 \pmod {12}</m>, read "14 is congruent to 2 modulo 12".  Think of it this way, 
            if you divide 14 by 12, the remainder is 2.  Another way to say this with respect to the <em>Division 
            Algorithm</em> is <m>14=12 \cdot 1 +2</m> where <m>n=14</m>, <m>d=12</m>, <m>q=1</m>, and <m>r=2</m>.  
            Anytime you make one lap around the clock, you are getting rid of a multiple of 12 so the place you 
            stop is the same as the remainder.  For this reason, <em>modular arithmetic</em> is often referred to 
            as <em>clock arithmetic</em>.

              What would be the reduced modular equivalent for <m>53\pmod {12}</m>?  This would be a number from 0 
              to 11 so that 53 has the same remainder when divided by 12.
              <me>53 \equiv \text{_______} \pmod {12}</me>

            </p>
            <p>
              Sometimes it is more convenient to express sums for a certain size clock with just the numerals using 
              a modified operation symbol.  For example, <m>7 \oplus 8=3</m> for a 12-hour clock.

              Since <m>14 \equiv 2 \pmod {12}</m>, is it true that <m>14 \cdot 5 \equiv 2 \cdot 5 \pmod {12}</m>?  
              Discuss with others in your group whether or not you think this will always work.  Justify your 
              position here.
            </p>
            <p>
              This product could also be expressed as <m>14 \otimes 5 =10</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now let us consider a smaller divisor or clock.  If we divide by 5, the possible remainders will be 
              0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.  In the previous clock, this would be similar to replacing the 12 with a 0 since if 
              a number is a multiple of 12 then when it is divided by 12 the remainder will be 0.  We can see the 
              "mod 5" clock in <xref ref="fig-mod-5-clock"/>.  In this clock, it can be seen that 
              <m>5 \equiv 0 \pmod 5</m>.
