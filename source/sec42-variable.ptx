  <title>Developing the Concept of Variable</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
       If you were to ask the typical person on the street to describe algebra, more than likely their first 
       response would have something to do with “letters” or variables.  The concept of variable is central to 
       the study of algebra.  Historically, the ability of mathematicians to use a symbol or collection of 
       symbols to represent quantities was a major breakthrough that allowed complex mathematical ideas to be 
       expressed in writing within a much smaller space.  Prior to this, it might have taken several pages of 
       prose to express a mathematical statement, theorem, or proof.  With the use of variables, the same idea 
       could be communicated in a single page or less within a single field of view.  This allowed the reader to 
       follow an argument or train of thought without flipping back and forth among many pages of text.  While 
       this may seem like a simple idea, it had major consequences on the development of mathematics.

        Although the use of variables proved to be an important advancement, it came with a price.  To 
        illustrate this price, think back to your first experience with function notation.  It is not uncommon 
        for a student to look at the collection of symbols, <m>f\left(x\right)</m>, and interpret it to mean 
        “multiply f by x”.  In mathematics, we often use similar symbol structures to communicate different 
        meanings.  In the example just given, the student often generalizes notation encountered earlier and 
        applies that meaning to a new situation.  This is consistent with Pirie and Kieren's (1994) construct of 
        folding back as it is applied to a symbol system.  When a student misinterprets function notation to 
        mean multiplication, it likely comes from their earlier experiences with multiplying integers such as 
        <m>\left(5\right)\cdot \left(-3\right)</m>.  Typically parentheses are used in this case when negative 
        integers are introduced so that the operation of subtraction is not confused with the negative sign 
        attached to the integer.  Hence the power of symbol use carries with it the problem of “unpacking” the 
        symbols to grasp their meaning.

    <title>Three Views of Letter Use</title>

        As we begin to examine the concept of variable, we will first restrict our discussion to the literature 
        surrounding the use of “letters” as a form of representation.  Using letters is probably the most 
        common vantage point regarding the concept of variable for most people.  In fact, one could argue that 
        a thumbnail definition of variable for most secondary school students could be characterized by “the 
        advanced study of the last three letters of the alphabet”.  For this reason, we first turn our attention 
        to the use of letters to represent variables.  Within this context, Trigueros and Ursini (2003) propose 
        three structural categories: <em>unknown number</em>, <em>generalized number</em>, and <em>functional 
        relationship</em>.
