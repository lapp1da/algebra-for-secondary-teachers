  <title>Developing the Concept of Variable</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
       If you were to ask the typical person on the street to describe algebra, more than likely their first 
       response would have something to do with “letters” or variables.  The concept of variable is central to 
       the study of algebra.  Historically, the ability of mathematicians to use a symbol or collection of 
       symbols to represent quantities was a major breakthrough that allowed complex mathematical ideas to be 
       expressed in writing within a much smaller space.  Prior to this, it might have taken several pages of 
       prose to express a mathematical statement, theorem, or proof.  With the use of variables, the same idea 
       could be communicated in a single page or less within a single field of view.  This allowed the reader to 
       follow an argument or train of thought without flipping back and forth among many pages of text.  While 
       this may seem like a simple idea, it had major consequences on the development of mathematics.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although the use of variables proved to be an important advancement, it came with a price.  To 
        illustrate this price, think back to your first experience with function notation.  It is not uncommon 
        for a student to look at the collection of symbols, <m>f\left(x\right)</m>, and interpret it to mean 
        “multiply f by x”.  In mathematics, we often use similar symbol structures to communicate different 
        meanings.  In the example just given, the student often generalizes notation encountered earlier and 
        applies that meaning to a new situation.  This is consistent with Pirie and Kieren's (1994) construct of 
        folding back as it is applied to a symbol system.  When a student misinterprets function notation to 
        mean multiplication, it likely comes from their earlier experiences with multiplying integers such as 
        <m>\left(5\right)\cdot \left(-3\right)</m>.  Typically parentheses are used in this case when negative 
        integers are introduced so that the operation of subtraction is not confused with the negative sign 
        attached to the integer.  Hence the power of symbol use carries with it the problem of “unpacking” the 
        symbols to grasp their meaning.

    <title>Three Views of Letter Use (Trigueros &amp; Ursini, 2003)</title>
    <p>
        As we begin to examine the concept of variable, we will first restrict our discussion to the literature 
        surrounding the use of “letters” as a form of representation.  Using letters is probably the most 
        common vantage point regarding the concept of variable for most people.  In fact, one could argue that 
        a thumbnail definition of variable for most secondary school students could be characterized by “the 
        advanced study of the last three letters of the alphabet”.  For this reason, we first turn our attention 
        to the use of letters to represent variables.  Within this context, Trigueros and Ursini (2003) propose 
        three structural categories: <em>unknown number</em>, <em>generalized number</em>, and <em>functional 
        relationship</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Unknown Number</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since one of the most useful applications of algebra is the solution of equations, it should come as no 
      surprise that variable as an unknown number is one way to view the concept of variable.  A variable may be 
      thought of as an unknown number when we are faced with a statement like <m>x^2-5x=-6</m> where there are 
      specific value(s) that the variable can take.  Recall from our example in the “Guess My Number” game 
      (see <xref ref="fig-guess-number"/>) played on computer algebra system.  In this game, the concept of 
      variable as an unknown number is one way to look at the use of the letter, <m>z</m>.  In this case, one 
      player has stored a specific value in the calculator's memory and linked it to the letter.  The second 
      player must then attempt discover the hidden value.  Here, there is a single value being used and thus the 
      letter, <m>z</m>, represents an unknown number.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Generalized Number</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the “Guess My Number” game can be viewed as using the concept of variable as an unknown number, 
      the continuation of play within the game illustrates our next perspective for interpreting variable.  
      Recall that the game is quite simple.  One player stores a number in the calculator as a letter and the 
      opponent's job is to guess it by using only expressions of inequalities or other expressions using the 
      letter.  As play continues in the game, the players repeatedly change the “unknown number” in order to 
      challenge their opponent.  It is this “changing of the unknown” that illustrates our second view of 
      variable as a <em>generalized number</em>.  In the instance of a generalized number, the variable may have 
      a less specific referent as compared to the unknown number.  In mathematics, we often use a variable to 
      express a generalized number while simultaneously allowing the possibility that it can also stand for an 
      unknown number within a specific context.  For example, consider <m>n</m> in the expression <m>2n+1</m>.  
      As we use this expression in a general sense to represent an odd integer, the symbol, <m>n</m>, is a 
      generalized number generating a set of various odd integers.  However, when we decide to place a 
      restriction on the same expression where we state that <m>2n+1=7</m>, <m>n</m> now represents an unknown 
      number rather than a generalized number.  So when we ask what <m>n</m> represents in the expression 
      <m>2n+1</m>, the answer is that it all depends on the question we are asking.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we develop notation, we often need a way to distinguish the difference between a generalized number and 
      a specific number.  You may recall from your study of Calculus, that mathematicians often do this by 
      using <m>f'\left(x\right)</m> to represent the generalized derivative of a function and the notation 
      <m>f'\left(x_0\right)</m> to represent the derivative at a specific point, 
      <m>\left(x_0, f\left(x_0\right)\right)</m>.  Although the format of the symbols is the same, there is an 
      implied difference that only a person enculturated into the mathematical community would necessarily see.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Variables in a Functional Relationship</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      The third view of variable given by Trigueros and Ursini is that of variables in a functional relationship.  
      Although this might seem similar to the view of generalized number stated earlier in the form of <m>2n+1</m>, 
      this conceptualization is different.  Here, Trigueros and Ursini refer to a specific relationship such as 
      Hook's Law, <m>F=kx</m>.  In this case, there is an implied variation involved between two variables where 
      the nature of the variation itself is of interest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whenever we consider a graph generated by an equation such as <m>y=x^2</m>, we are witnessing variables in 
      a <em>functional relationship</em>.  We can ask questions such as, how does change in one variable affect 
      change in another?  How fast is one variable changing with respect to the other?  What happens to <m>y</m> 
      as <m>x</m> gets very large in the positive direction?  Compared to the view of variable as a generalized 
      number where an expression like <m>2n+1</m> simply stands for an arbitrary odd integer, the view of 
      variables in a functional relationship carries with it a context aimed at describing relationships.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Merging Views of Variable</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      As we consider the ways in which students use the concept of variable (in this case the use of letters or 
      symbols to represent variables) we may be concerned with which view should come first or which view is the 
      most important.  However, we would like to propose that these questions are of lesser concern.  If we are 
      interested in helping students build a deeper conceptualization of variable, we must ask ourselves how do 
      students connect all of these views?  We posit that the issue on conceptual connection is far more 
      important than which view should come first, although we acknowledge that the concern of order might impact 
      the question of connection.  Our argument is that in order for students to develop a concept of variable, 
      they must be able to merge these views of variable and be ably to flexibly move among them.  In addition, 
      not only do students need to be able to move among varying views of variable, they must also be able to 
      navigate back and forth between symbols and meaning (Sfard, 2000).  Therefore, the question then becomes, 
      how do we develop curricula that encourage students to move back and forth among various views of variable 
      across multiple representations?  In this section, we have focused on the symbolic representation of 
      variable, but we will spend more time looking at other representations in a section devoted specifically to 
      this issue.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>Tools for Merging Views of Variable</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      As far as the symbolic representation is concerned, one resource we have to help students merge various 
      views of the concept of variable is the use of computer algebra systems (CAS).  In order to discuss this 
      issue and the use of a technical tool such as CAS we feel it necessary to first disclose the theoretical 
      perspective that we use to approach the development of conceptual understanding.  While scholars debate the 
      merits and drawbacks of various theoretical perspectives ranging from radical constructivism to 
      socio-cultural paradigms, we consider ourselves to be social constructivists.  What this means is that we 
      believe students develop mathematical understanding from both internal and external influences.  Cognitive 
      conflict from within a learner is a powerful mechanism for conceptual change, but the influence of the 
      mathematical community is also a powerful tool.  So why do we worry about our theoretical perspective 
      here?  Well, the use of CAS carries with it an implied pre-ordained structure set forth by the mathematical 
      community.  In order for a student to use a CAS, there is certain syntax and structure that must be 
      followed.  In this case, the more open view of radical constructivism as a theory of concept development 
      become problematic while within the social constructivist view students may first develop notation, but 
      later be forced to conform to the community's notation needed to use CAS as a tool for exploration.  In 
      addition, there may be times where the teacher must introduce notation even before the meaning has been 
      explored.  Is this a concern?  We tend to side with Sfard's (2000) perspective when she states:
    </p>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          [I]nstead of asking “What comes first?” we would rather give thought to the question of how to 
          orchestrate and facilitate the back-and-forth movement between symbols and meaning.  This seems to be 
          the only way to cope with the problem of circularity that is inherent in discourse that creates its 
          own objects.  (p. 92)
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      The issue of the symbiotic relationship between notation and concept is important.  Often in mathematics, 
      notation drives concept development in a way similar to the reverse relationship where the concept drives 
      the notation.  To think that there is a single approach appropriate to all situations, limits creativity 
      and produces a very narrow view to teaching and learning.  We would rather let the classroom context guide 
      the order of this relationship.  It is often the translation among notation systems that helps deepen the 
      concept and therefore as Sfard posits, we seek more to aid in the translation.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to illustrate this notational translation and the deepening of concepts, consider the use of a CAS 
      to work with sequences and series.  In standard mathematical notation, we often refer to a sequence or 
      series with notation such as <m>a_n=\frac{x^n}{n!}</m> and <m>\sum\limits^{\infty}_{n=0}{\frac{x^n}{n!}}</m>.  
      The problem is that in order to explore these mathematical objects using CAS we must first translate these 
      into computer or “calculator speak”.  The use of function notation helps us to deal with subscripts and 
      variables within one symbol system while encouraging students to focus attention on a dual variation 
      happening within a single expression.  For example, in the sequence we have two quantities that can 
      “vary”—the term index and the input variable.  In translating this to a useful language in a CAS, we 
      define <m>a\left(x,n\right)=\frac{x^n}{n!}</m>.  The use of a function of two variables serves us in three 
      ways.  The first is the ability to quickly evaluate a specific term of the sequence using a simple input 
      such as <m>a\left(0.6,13\right)</m> to represent the evaluation of the 13th term using <m>x=0.6</m>.  This 
      encourages the student to create an object and then operate on it in a very abstract way.  The second 
      benefit we gain is the cognitive conflict that is generated by the notational use.  As stated earlier, when 
      students are introduced to function notation, they often confuse the use of parentheses to separate the 
      function name from the input variable with the operation of multiplication between integers.  The fact that 
      a comma is being used within the parentheses causes the student to pause and re-evaluate his/her 
      understanding of the notation.  A byproduct of this re-evaluation is that the student may realize that 
      there are two quantities that can vary within the expression.
    </p>

    <p>
      The third benefit we gain from the use of CAS is the ability of the student to move from an understanding 
      of the expression as a process to that of an object.  This goes beyond the simple evaluation of the 
      sequence and allows the student to explore general behavior.  For example, if we wish to explore the 
      convergence of the series <m>\sum\limits^{\infty}_{n=0}{\frac{x^n}{n!}}</m>, we can combine previously defined 
      objects to create another sequence describing the <m>k^{th}</m> partial sum.  In this case we might define 
      <m>s\left(x,k\right)=\sum\limits^{\infty}_{n=0}{a\left(x,n\right)}</m>.  Here the students are encouraged to make 
      sense of the parts of the definition in order to understand the meaning.  It is important to note that the 
      design of the curricula utilizing this approach is crucial so that students will simply try to memorize 
      procedures.  Deliberate questions must be present to guide the students to make the connections among 
      notation systems and meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
      The moral of this story is that technology can serve as a powerful tool for merging different views of 
      variable.  The challenge is that the classroom environment must transform to allow discourse so that 
      students feel comfortable with both processes of creation and translation of notation.  The teacher must be 
      cognizant of the interplay among the processes involved in this dynamic in order to successfully 
      orchestrate the classroom to allow the formation of algebraic concepts with the depth we desire.
