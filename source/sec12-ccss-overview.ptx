  <title>Common Core State Standards for Mathematics</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The <em>Common Core State Standards for Mathematics</em> (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010) are broken into two areas.  
      When most people think of mathematics standards, the first things that come to mind are usually standards 
      related to what mathematics will be taught.  We refer to these as the 
      <em>Standards for Mathematical Content</em> or more simply, the <em>Content Standards</em>.  Since 
      this is the most common expectation, in this section, we will discuss it first.  However, the other 
      equally-important part of the CCSS are the <em>Standards for Mathematical Practice</em> that lay out the 
      expectations for "habits of mind" that we need students to have in order to do mathematics.  We will adress 
      these <em>Math Practices</em> in the next section.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-content-standards">
    <title>CCSS: Content Standards</title>
    
  

  <p>
    The Content Standards are broken down by grade level for the K-8 grades, but then are arranged by content 
    areas once we get to high school.  The standards are organized into domains that progress over several 
    grades so that it is easier to see learning trajectories and expectations as students move through the 
    curriculum.  For each grade in the K-8 band, the grade begins with generally 2 to 4 focal points to show 
    the broader goals for that particular grade.  Since at the high school level, students in various grades may 
    be taking different mathematics classes than their counterparts, standards are presented by conceptual 
    theme (<em>Number and Quantity</em>, <em>Algebra</em>, <em>Functions</em>, <em>Modeling</em>, 
    <em>Geometry</em>, <em>Statistics and Probability</em>).
  </p>

  <p>
    The Content Standards are more specific and define what students should understand and be able to do and 
    thus are the most refined categorization.  Since many of these standards are linked, the standards are then 
    organized into <em>Clusters</em> which are groups of related standards.  <em>Domains</em> are then larger 
    groups that progress across grades (see <xref ref="fig-ccss-organization"/>).

    Within the K-8 band, the standards for that grade begin with an overview of what is expected.  This gives the 
    teacher a broad view of the goals for that grade level (see <xref ref="fig-ccss-grade5-overview"/>).

    You will notice in the Grade 5 Overview, <em>Operations and Algebraic Thinking</em> appear first.  For many 
    people, "algebra" means manipulating letters and symbols, but the CCSS have algebraic thinking as a goal 
    beginning in kindergarten.  Algebra is far more than the maipulating of symbols and the movement toward 
    abstraction begins early.  Algebraic thinking involves noticing, expressing, and analyzing patterns and these 
    are activities where young learners excel until our curriculum often suppresses it by focusing on 
    memorization and procedural fluency.  We will discuss the nature of algebra in greater detail later in the 
    text, but for now, it is important to realize that the foundation for what we want students to be able to 
    understand later in formal algebra courses begins with patterning.  For an interesting read on how 
    algebra develops in young learners, consider, <em>Algebra in the Early Grades</em> by Kaput, Carraher, and 
    Blanton (2008).  
  </p>

  <p>
    As the CCSS get to Grade 8, there is a more deliberate move toward symbolization.  Here the expectations 
    include things like  "Analyze and solve linear equations and pairs of simultaneous linear equations",  
    "Define, evaluate, and compare functions", and "Use functions to model relationships between quantities".  
    This does not mean that symbolic forms are not expected in the earlier grades, but rather that in Grade 8, 
    formalization of these concepts should be a focus of the curriculum.  For this reason, the CCSS also provides 
    a summary of <em>focal points</em> at the beginning of each grade level (K-8).  An example of this can be 
    seen in <xref ref="fig-ccss-grade8-focal-points"/>.

  </p>

  <p>
    The high school standards, as stated earlier, are organized into the conceptual themes of 
    <em>Number and Quantity</em>, <em>Algebra</em>, <em>Functions</em>, <em>Modeling</em>, 
    <em>Geometry</em>, <em>Statistics and Probability</em>.  For the purpose of this text, we will focus mainly 
    on <em>Algebra</em>, but keep in mind that it is difficult to discuss algebraic ideas without the use of 
    <em>Functions</em> and <em>Modeling</em> as these applications drive much of our need for algebraic 
    structure.  Like the K-8 grade-level standards, the high school standards also give a summary of focal 
    points for each theme so that the teacher has an idea of how the content should be approached when teaching
    it.

    <title>CCSS: Standards for Mathematical Practice</title>
  <p>
    While the mathematical content of what should be taught at various grade levels is often the major focus of 
    the curriculum or standards, there is a much broader view that is equally important when it comes to 
    developing mathematical thinking.  It is not enough to "know" content.  If we realize that mathematics is a 
    creative endeavor, we must also address the <em>habits of mind</em> that need to be developed for mathematical 
    thinking.  For this reason, the Common Core State Standards was intentionally partitioned into two parts 
    in order to make this point clear.  We have described the Content Standards, but now we need to address the 
    <em>Standards for Mathematical Practice</em> (see <xref ref="fig-ccss-math-practices-list"/>).  These 
    standards describe the 8 basic habits of mind that we need students to possess in order to use the 
    mathematics content knowledge effectively and creatively.
