  <title>Common Core State Standards for Mathematics</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The <em>Common Core State Standards for Mathematics</em> (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010) are broken into two areas.  
      When most people think of mathematics standards, the first things that come to mind are usually standards 
      related to what mathematics will be taught.  We refer to these as the 
      <em>Standards for Mathematical Content</em> or more simply, the <em>Content Standards</em>.  Since 
      this is the most common expectation, in this section, we will discuss it first.  However, the other 
      equally-important part of the CCSS are the <em>Standards for Mathematical Practice</em> that lay out the 
      expectations for "habits of mind" that we need students to have in order to do mathematics.  We will adress 
      these <em>Math Practices</em> in the next section.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-content-standards">
    <title>CCSS: Content Standards</title>
    
  

  <p>
    The Content Standards are broken down by grade level for the K-8 grades, but then are arranged by content 
    areas once we get to high school.  The standards are organized into domains that progress over several 
    grades so that it is easier to see learning trajectories and expectations as students move through the 
    curriculum.  For each grade in the K-8 band, the grade begins with generally 2 to 4 focal points to show 
    the broader goals for that particular grade.  Since at the high school level, students in various grades may 
    be taking different mathematics classes than their counterparts, standards are presented by conceptual 
    theme (<em>Number and Quantity</em>, <em>Algebra</em>, <em>Functions</em>, <em>Modeling</em>, 
    <em>Geometry</em>, <em>Statistics and Probability</em>).
  </p>

  <p>
    The Content Standards are more specific and define what students should understand and be able to do and 
    thus are the most refined categorization.  Since many of these standards are linked, the standards are then 
    organized into <em>Clusters</em> which are groups of related standards.  <em>Domains</em> are then larger 
    groups that progress across grades (see <xref ref="fig-ccss-organization"/>).

  </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    Within the K-8 band, the standards for that grade begin with an overview of what is expected.  This gives the 
    teacher a broad view of the goals for that grade level (see <xref ref="fig-ccss-grade5-overview"/>).

  </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    You will notice in the Grade 5 Overview, <em>Operations and Algebraic Thinking</em> appear first.  For many 
    people, "algebra" means manipulating letters and symbols, but the CCSS have algebraic thinking as a goal 
    beginning in kindergarten.  Algebra is far more than the maipulating of symbols and the movement toward 
    abstraction begins early.  Algebraic thinking involves noticing, expressing, and analyzing patterns and these 
    are activities where young learners excel until our curriculum often suppresses it by focusing on 
    memorization and procedural fluency.  We will discuss the nature of algebra in greater detail later in the 
    text, but for now, it is important to realize that the foundation for what we want students to be able to 
    understand later in formal algebra courses begins with patterning.  For an interesting read on how 
    algebra develops in young learners, consider, <em>Algebra in the Early Grades</em> by Kaput, Carraher, and 
    Blanton (2008).  
  </p>

  <p>
    As the CCSS get to Grade 8, there is a more deliberate move toward symbolization.  Here the expectations 
    include things like  "Analyze and solve linear equations and pairs of simultaneous linear equations",  
    "Define, evaluate, and compare functions", and "Use functions to model relationships between quantities".  
    This does not mean that symbolic forms are not expected in the earlier grades, but rather that in Grade 8, 
    formalization of these concepts should be a focus of the curriculum.  For this reason, the CCSS also provides 
    a summary of <em>focal points</em> at the beginning of each grade level (K-8).  An example of this can be 
    seen in <xref ref="fig-ccss-grade8-focal-points"/>.

  </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    The high school standards, as stated earlier, are organized into the conceptual themes of 
    <em>Number and Quantity</em>, <em>Algebra</em>, <em>Functions</em>, <em>Modeling</em>, 
    <em>Geometry</em>, <em>Statistics and Probability</em>.  For the purpose of this text, we will focus mainly 
    on <em>Algebra</em>, but keep in mind that it is difficult to discuss algebraic ideas without the use of 
    <em>Functions</em> and <em>Modeling</em> as these applications drive much of our need for algebraic 
    structure.  Like the K-8 grade-level standards, the high school standards also give a summary of focal 
    points for each theme so that the teacher has an idea of how the content should be approached when teaching
    it.

    <title>CCSS: Standards for Mathematical Practice</title>
  <p>
    While the mathematical content of what should be taught at various grade levels is often the major focus of 
    the curriculum or standards, there is a much broader view that is equally important when it comes to 
    developing mathematical thinking.  It is not enough to "know" content.  If we realize that mathematics is a 
    creative endeavor, we must also address the <em>habits of mind</em> that need to be developed for mathematical 
    thinking.  For this reason, the Common Core State Standards was intentionally partitioned into two parts 
    in order to make this point clear.  In fact, when you read through the CCSS, you will notice that these 
    habits or mind are actually listed first before the Content Standards are addressed.  This drives home the 
    importance of these mental processes that are so essential for preparing students to be good mathematical 
    thinkers (or overall critical thinkers for that matter).  We have described the Content Standards, but 
    now we need to address the <em>Standards for Mathematical Practice</em> 
    (see <xref ref="fig-ccss-math-practices-list"/>).  These standards describe the 8 basic habits of mind that 
    we need students to possess in order to use the mathematics content knowledge effectively and creatively.  In 
    the list below, you can see greater detail for what is intended by each practice by clicking on the "hint" 
    link below the listed practice.

        Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
        <hint>
          <p>
            "Mathematically proficient students start by explaining to themselves the meaning
            of a problem and looking for entry points to its solution. They analyze givens,
            constraints, relationships, and goals. They make conjectures about the form and
            meaning of the solution and plan a solution pathway rather than simply jumping into
            a solution attempt. They consider analogous problems, and try special cases and
            simpler forms of the original problem in order to gain insight into its solution. They
            monitor and evaluate their progress and change course if necessary. Older students
            might, depending on the context of the problem, transform algebraic expressions or
            change the viewing window on their graphing calculator to get the information they
            need. Mathematically proficient students can explain correspondences between
            equations, verbal descriptions, tables, and graphs or draw diagrams of important
            features and relationships, graph data, and search for regularity or trends. Younger
            students might rely on using concrete objects or pictures to help conceptualize
            and solve a problem. Mathematically proficient students check their answers to
            problems using a different method, and they continually ask themselves, “Does this
            make sense?” They can understand the approaches of others to solving complex
            problems and identify correspondences between different approaches." (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010, p. 6)

        Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
        <hint>
          <p>
            "Mathematically proficient students make sense of quantities and their relationships
            in problem situations. They bring two complementary abilities to bear on problems
            involving quantitative relationships: the ability to decontextualize—to abstract
            a given situation and represent it symbolically and manipulate the representing
            symbols as if they have a life of their own, without necessarily attending to
            their referents—and the ability to contextualize, to pause as needed during the
            manipulation process in order to probe into the referents for the symbols involved.
            Quantitative reasoning entails habits of creating a coherent representation of
            the problem at hand; considering the units involved; attending to the meaning of
            quantities, not just how to compute them; and knowing and flexibly using different
            properties of operations and objects." (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010, p. 6)

        Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.
        <hint>
          <p>
            "Mathematically proficient students understand and use stated assumptions,
            definitions, and previously established results in constructing arguments. They
            make conjectures and build a logical progression of statements to explore the
            truth of their conjectures. They are able to analyze situations by breaking them into
            cases, and can recognize and use counterexamples. They justify their conclusions,
            communicate them to others, and respond to the arguments of others. They reason
            inductively about data, making plausible arguments that take into account the
            context from which the data arose. Mathematically proficient students are also able
            to compare the effectiveness of two plausible arguments, distinguish correct logic or
            reasoning from that which is flawed, and—if there is a flaw in an argument—explain
            what it is. Elementary students can construct arguments using concrete referents
            such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and actions. Such arguments can make sense
            and be correct, even though they are not generalized or made formal until later
            grades. Later, students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies.
            Students at all grades can listen or read the arguments of others, decide whether
            they make sense, and ask useful questions to clarify or improve the arguments."

        Model with mathematics.
        <hint>
          <p>
            "Mathematically proficient students can apply the mathematics they know to solve
            problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace. In early grades, this might
            be as simple as writing an addition equation to describe a situation. In middle grades,
            a student might apply proportional reasoning to plan a school event or analyze a
            problem in the community. By high school, a student might use geometry to solve a
            design problem or use a function to describe how one quantity of interest depends
            on another. Mathematically proficient students who can apply what they know are
            comfortable making assumptions and approximations to simplify a complicated
            situation, realizing that these may need revision later. They are able to identify
            important quantities in a practical situation and map their relationships using such
            tools as diagrams, two-way tables, graphs, flowcharts and formulas. They can analyze
            those relationships mathematically to draw conclusions. They routinely interpret their
            mathematical results in the context of the situation and reflect on whether the results
            make sense, possibly improving the model if it has not served its purpose."

      <p>
        Use appropriate tools strategically.
        <hint>
          <p>
            "Mathematically proficient students consider the available tools when solving a
            mathematical problem. These tools might include pencil and paper, concrete
            models, a ruler, a protractor, a calculator, a spreadsheet, a computer algebra system,
            a statistical package, or dynamic geometry software. Proficient students are
            sufficiently familiar with tools appropriate for their grade or course to make sound
            decisions about when each of these tools might be helpful, recognizing both the
            insight to be gained and their limitations. For example, mathematically proficient
            high school students analyze graphs of functions and solutions generated using a
            graphing calculator. They detect possible errors by strategically using estimation
            and other mathematical knowledge. When making mathematical models, they know
            that technology can enable them to visualize the results of varying assumptions,
            explore consequences, and compare predictions with data. Mathematically
            proficient students at various grade levels are able to identify relevant external
            mathematical resources, such as digital content located on a website, and use them
            to pose or solve problems. They are able to use technological tools to explore and
            deepen their understanding of concepts."

          <p>
            "Mathematically proficient students try to communicate precisely to others. They
            try to use clear definitions in discussion with others and in their own reasoning.
            They state the meaning of the symbols they choose, including using the equal sign
            consistently and appropriately. They are careful about specifying units of measure,
            and labeling axes to clarify the correspondence with quantities in a problem. They
            calculate accurately and efficiently, express numerical answers with a degree of
            precision appropriate for the problem context. In the elementary grades, students
            give carefully formulated explanations to each other. By the time they reach high
            school they have learned to examine claims and make explicit use of definitions."

        Look for and make use of structure.
        <hint>
          <p>
            "Mathematically proficient students look closely to discern a pattern or structure.
            Young students, for example, might notice that three and seven more is the same
            amount as seven and three more, or they may sort a collection of shapes according
            to how many sides the shapes have. Later, students will see <m>7 \times 8</m> equals the
            well remembered <m>7 \times 5 +7 \times 3</m>, in preparation for learning about the distributive
            property. In the expression <m>x^2+9x+14</m>, older students can see the 14 as <m>2 \times 7</m> and
            the 9 as <m>2+7</m>. They recognize the significance of an existing line in a geometric
            figure and can use the strategy of drawing an auxiliary line for solving problems.
            They also can step back for an overview and shift perspective. They can see
            complicated things, such as some algebraic expressions, as single objects or as
            being composed of several objects. For example, they can see <m>5-3\left(x-y\right)^2</m> as 5
            minus a positive number times a square and use that to realize that its value cannot
            be more than 5 for any real numbers x and y."

        Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.
        <hint>
          <p>
            "Mathematically proficient students notice if calculations are repeated, and look
            both for general methods and for shortcuts. Upper elementary students might
            notice when dividing 25 by 11 that they are repeating the same calculations over
            and over again, and conclude they have a repeating decimal. By paying attention
            to the calculation of slope as they repeatedly check whether points are on the line
            through (1, 2) with slope 3, middle school students might abstract the equation
            <m>(y-2)/(x-1) = 3</m>. Noticing the regularity in the way terms cancel when expanding
            <m>(x-1)(x+1)</m>, <m>(x-1)(x^2 + x + 1)</m>, and <m>(x-1)(x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)</m> might lead them 
            to the general formula for the sum of a geometric series. As they work to solve a problem,
            mathematically proficient students maintain oversight of the process, while
            attending to the details. They continually evaluate the reasonableness of their
            intermediate results." (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010, p. 8)

    One of the challenges teachers face is to connect the <em>Content Standards</em> using the 
    <em>Standards for Mathematical Practice</em>.  How do we go about eliciting student thinking about 
    mathematics and engaging them in productive struggle where they can gain experience using these 8 
    practices?  In the next subsection, we will take a look at some ways to accomplish this by trying to 
    identify elements of these standards within our own mathematical exploration.  Throughtout this text, we 
    will also watch video cases and read written vignettes where actual secondary students are grappling with 
    both mathematical content and practices.  We will analyze these situations and build our own instincts as 
    teachers to better engage our future students in mathematical development.
