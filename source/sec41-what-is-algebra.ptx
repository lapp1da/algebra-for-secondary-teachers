  <title>What Is Algebra?</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        In the preparation of secondary mathematics teachers, it is important to situate the content of algebra 
        within the overall mathematical education of the learner.  Where does algebra begin?  For quite a few 
        years, there has been a call for “algebra for all” in the eighth grade (Usiskin, 1987).  The Principles 
        and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM, 2000) and the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics 
        (CCSS-M) (NGACBP &amp; CCSSO, 2010) have an algebra strand that runs through the spectrum of the 
        curriculum from pre-Kindergarten through grade 12.  The traditional place for algebra has been at the 
        beginning of secondary school (usually at the ninth grade) for most students.  Why then, does NCTM, CCSS, and 
        others place algebra as a strand beginning in preschool education?  Here we will address two major 
        reasons that “algebra” is now being considered at lower grades: (1) our understanding about what 
        constitutes algebra has significantly changed over the last few decades and (2) the advent of newer 
        technologies has provided the opportunity for students to begin abstracting ideas at younger ages.
    </p>
 </introduction>

    <p>
        <em>Algebraic Reasoning</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Within the traditional culture algebra has been viewed as the collection of symbol manipulations and 
        rules that govern them.  This can be seen by the remarks given by the student in the TIMSS excerpt 
        shared at the opening of this module.  Here the student states, “It's kind of a set in stone.  It's 
        procedure.  It's a formula.  You learn the formula and you know how to do math.”  This view of algebra 
        as a collection of letters on a page has often stood in the way of exposing younger students to 
        algebraic ideas because the feeling was that in order for students to do algebra, they must be able to 
        use letters to represent mathematical ideas.  Recent research; however, has suggested that younger 
        students might be capable of symbolizing mathematical ideas (Carraher, Schielmann, Brizuela, &amp; 
        Earnest, 2006).  But even if a student does not currently symbolize mathematical ideas in the 
        traditional “algebraic” sense, does that mean they are not doing algebra?  The basic assumption of the 
        CCSS-M and NCTM Standards is that algebraic ideas develop over time and that the ability to directly 
        symbolize is neither necessary nor sufficient to learn algebra.  As you recall from our discussion of 
        the Pirie and Kieren model for growth of mathematical understanding, the development of the concepts of 
        algebra take place on various levels and evolve as the learner participates in experiences that advance 
        the growth.  The student may still be doing algebra even though they are not directly manipulating symbols.
    </p>

    <p>
        To illustrate a young learner “doing” algebra, consider the following example from parenting experience.  
        When my son was in first grade, I had taken him and his sisters to a local fast food establishment.  
        At this particular restaurant, there was a children's area equipped with the standard network of “gerbil 
        tubes” for the children to climb through as they frequently took breaks from eating.  Now my son became 
        tired of climbing around and sat down next to me at the table to see what I was doing.  I had been 
        playing with my TI-89 calculator equipped with a computer algebra system (CAS) and he asked me to show 
        him what it would do.  I knew that in his classroom he was studying inequality and so I asked if he 
        wanted to play a game.  Being bored, he quickly said yes and so I explained the rules to a game I called, 
        “Guess My Number”.  The game is quite simple (as the name suggests) and so I told him that I would store 
        a number in the calculator and his job was to guess it by using only expressions of inequalities.  I 
        stored a number in the variable <m>z</m> as shown in <xref ref="fig-guess-number"/> and then cleared the 
        screen.  My son then tried to guess the number by entering an inequality and reading the response.  He 
        then proceeded to try other inequalities until he thought he could guess the number.  He thought this was 
        a fun game and so I stored another number in <m>z</m> and we started again.  My son was fascinated with 
        the idea that I could change <m>z</m> and play again.  Now this may not seem like algebra, but this 
        simple activity was building the concept of variable in a first grader.  It should also be noted that in 
        this simple game, the three main views of variable (<em>unknown quantity</em>, 
        <em>generalized quantity</em>, and <em>quantities in a functional relationship</em>) are all present.  
        This type of algebraic reasoning <em>is</em> mathematics.  The recognition of algebraic reasoning as a 
        significant part of algebra has prompted us to better characterize what younger students do in 
        mathematics and consider algebra a preK-12 endeavor.

  <p>
    <em>Technology and Abstraction</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Due to the traditional perspective of algebra, we have been hesitant to challenge students to abstraction 
    before we feel they are ready.  Piaget's work has suggested that we need to be mindful of the developmental 
    stage of our students and that younger students may not be physiologically capable of doing certain abstract 
    tasks.  Although we must acknowledge the limitations that students possess within their developmental 
    progress toward abstraction, we must also seek experiences that will help them reach higher levels of 
    abstraction.  As in the Pirie and Kieren (1994) model, the continual advancing and folding back to expand 
    understanding is part of the process that helps move students along.  Technology is one mechanism that can 
    assist students in the ability to abstract mathematical concepts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Much like the example given above where a young child plays the game, “Guess My Number”, a computer algebra 
    system (CAS) can play an important role in developing abstract representations.  One might suggest that one 
    of the most powerful pedagogical tools available in a CAS is the <em>Define</em> command.  This command 
    allows the student to name a mathematical expression and then act on it by its name as if it was an object.  
    Arnon et al. (2014) use this construct in their APOS Theory.  APOS Theory refers to viewing mathematical 
    development through a four-stage structure.  APOS refers to <em>Action-Process-Object-Schema</em> where 
    the learner transistions through these stages much like Piaget's stages.  The learner first does some action 
    to interact with the mathematical idea.  This leads to viewing it as a process that is eventually treated as 
    an object.  Once it is viewed as an object, it can be acted on and placed into a broader structure or schema.  
    While the <em>Define</em> command may seem a trivial function of a CAS, it is an important feature in 
    representing mathematical ideas in a way that they can be acted upon and thus the learner can begin placing 
    a mathematical idea(s) into a coherent system.  Kaput, Blanton and Moreno (2008) suggest that it is the 
    student's interaction with notation that builds meaning of the notation.  As in the “Guess My Number” game, 
    students must choose the notation (i.e. <m>\lt</m>, <m>\gt</m>, <m>=</m>) and then observe the results of those choices.  By this 
    trial and error experience, meaning is developed in a much deeper way than simply listening to a teacher 
    tell them what each symbol represents.  We can all be told a definition, but it is not until we must use the 
    definition that we obtain a gut-level understanding of its meaning.  No one can do this for us.  We must do 
    it ourselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is evidence to suggest that children at age 9 and 10 have the ability to represent mathematical 
    concepts and relationships using algebraic notation (Carraher, Schliemann, Brizuela, &amp; Earnest, 2006).  
    Brizuela and Schliemann (2004) found that students in this age range could not only represent mathematical 
    ideas algebraically, but could also use this notation to solve problems within an algebraic environment.  
    This does not mean that we simply start using symbolic notation with young children.  The students in the 
    studies mentioned were first exposed to activities that helped them develop the ability to work on a more 
    abstract level.
  </p>

  <p>
    To illustrate how the concept of variable might be developed in young children we have previously shared the 
    “Guess My Number” game.  There are; however, other experiences that, over time, help to slowly expose the 
    student to algebraic representation.  In the elementary grades, students are required by most school 
    districts to learn basic word processing and spreadsheet functionality.  The use of a spreadsheet can help 
    the student construct a concept image (Tall &amp; Vinner, 1981) of variable by simply formatting one cell in 
    relation to another.  Consider the following problem posed to a group of fourth graders 
    (<xref ref="fig-youve-got-mail"/>).
  </p>

  <p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-youve-got-mail">
        <caption>You've Got Mail Activity</caption>
        <image source="images/youve-got-mail.png" width="80%">
            <shortdescription>You've Got Mail Activity</shortdescription>
        </image>
    </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    In response to the problem, some students began by using a spreadsheet and formating it to fit the table.  A 
    sample of the students' approach can be seen in <xref ref="fig-youve-got-mail-spreadsheet"/>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-youve-got-mail-spreadsheet">
        <caption>Sample Spreadsheet Created by Fourth Graders</caption>

            <shortdescription>Sample Spreadsheet</shortdescription>
        </image>
    </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    In this instance the student clicks on the cells they wish to use in the calculation of the postage (A2 and 
    B2).  Those cell names are then expressed in the command line and the postage calculation is given by 
    “=A2*0.03+B2*0.05”.  As simple as this exercise may seem, even young children are capable of understanding 
    what the spreadsheet is doing.  The students are beginning to represent “changeable” quantities by 
    expressions like A2 and B2.  Later in this exploration, the students used the “Fill Down” command to copy 
    the expression relative to the corresponding cells in columns <m>\mathbf{A}</m> and <m>\mathbf{B}</m> in 
    other rows so that they could continue to test various combinations of 3¢ and 5¢ stamps.  Here they were not 
    only using the fact that the expressions in column <m>\mathbf{C}</m> were “changeable”, but that the values 
    in columns <m>\mathbf{A}</m> and <m>\mathbf{B}</m> were as well.  The experience that cell values can be 
    changed and that those changes affect the postage calculation helps lay the groundwork for the concept of 
    variable which we will discuss further in the next section.

    Here we have tried to describe how technology can be used to help advance algebraic reasoning and concept 
    development at a young age.  What about secondary school students?  Throughout this course we have used 
    similar strategies tied to technology such as computer algebra systems, dynamic geometry systems, and data 
    collection devices to give you experience implementing these approaches in both your own learning of 
    mathematics as well as your reflection on pedagogical uses in the secondary classroom.  We live in a 
    technological world and so to think we can teach meaningful mathematics that is relevant to today's society 
    without the use of technology is simply misguided and certainly not supported by the decades of research on 
    the use of technology in the teaching and learning of mathematics.
  </p>

    So what exactly is algebra?  Some view it as an extension of arithmetic (a generalized arithmetic or number 
    if you will).  However, Davydov (1999) showed that students could actually develop algebraic structure through 
    relationships between quantities instead.  The students that Davydov worked with and the subsequent curriculum 
    developed has been successful in allowing younger children to develop both the structural view of algebra 
    while symbolizing these structural relationships.  Schmittau and Morris (2004) used Davydov's curriculum with 
    elementary children in the US and found that by the end, the children could use their understanding to solve 
    algebraic problem typically reserved for secondary school students in the US.

  <p>
    Algebra is more than simply moving symbols around a page.  The algebraic reasoning that allows the learner 
    to understand why certain processes work is just as important (if not more) as the ability to perform the 
    symbolic manipulations.  The research on use of computer algebra systems clearly shows that CAS can actually 
    be used to help develop by-hand skills <em>and</em> conceptual understanding.  In a technological world, the 
    emphasis that used to be placed on by-hand skills needs to be reduced since many of those skills are not as 
    important as they used to be.  For instance, it was not that long ago that the curriculum required students 
    to be able to compute <m>\sqrt{3}</m> to four decimal places by hand.  Today, we would look at that part of 
    the curriculum and ask why?  Every calcultor has a square root button, so is there a need for proficiency 
    at doing this computation?  It is far more important that a student understand that if we multiply that 
    1.73205ish number by itself, we get 3.  That is the <em>concept</em> of square root.  Ability to compute it 
    by hand is simply not necessary and so this is why the curriculum stopped requiring it.  In the same sense, 
    future generations will ask why we spent so much time making sure students could proficiently do much of 
    the symbolic manipulation we currently require when CAS was available to allow students to focus on thinking 
    rather than symbol pushing.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to the use of CAS for exploring patterns, meaning of symbolic manipulations can come from the use of 
    other resources such as manipulatives.  Recall that back in <xref ref="act-multiplying-fractions"/>, we used an 
    area model to examine how we multiply fractions.  Similarly, we can also use physical models for exploring 
    properties of symbolic expressions when we multiply them.  The physical manipulatives we use for this purpose 
    are called <em>algebra tiles</em> and they are just area (or sometimes volume) models that involve more than 
    just numerical values, but also "unknown" amounts.  In these tiles, there are objects that have lengths that 
    are clearly not a whole number multiples of the other "unit" objects in the set.  These are our "unknown" variables 
    and so we can create area models that involve both variables and integers and combinations of them.

      <title>Algebra Tiles and Factoring Trinomials</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Suppose you are teaching a high school Algebra 1 class and are tasked with teaching factoring trinomials 
          into a product of two binomials?  How might you start?  Traditionally, the teacher would show many examples 
          where they perform this process and then the students are given some trinomials to practice.  The problem 
          with this approach is that it is promoting mimicking and not thinking.  So how might we change this 
          instructional sequence to better promote thinking and reasoning so that the student discover the process we 
          want them to do as opposed to purely memorize it?

            In front of you, you have a physical set of algebra tiles (or you can use the virtual ones above in 
            <xref ref="fig-algebra-tiles-interactive"/>).  Using the variable length tiles, "<m>x</m>", along with 
            unit tiles, try to form a rectangle with length, <m>x+2</m>, on one side and length, <m>x+3</m>, on the

            rectangle.  How many of each type of tile did you use to fill in the rectangle?  What polynomial would the

            in part (a).  On your whiteboards, draw a sketch of your area model labeling the tiles you used to fill in the

  <p>
    <xref ref="act-algebra-tiles"/> highlights how we can help students develop an understanding of algebraic structure 
    through the use of physical manipulatives.  The processes and relationships among coefficients in the factored and 
    expanded forms of these expressions go beyond the simple memorization of an acronym like FOIL.  There is meaning 
    behind where these tiles end up in the resulting rectangles and the distributive property is at the heart of this 
    explanation.  For many students, FOIL is considered a mathematical property, while a true property like the 
    Distributive Property is forgotten.  This is what we mean by bringing meaning to structure.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    Seeing structure is at the heart of grasping algebraic concepts, but structure is often the part of the 
    algebra curriculum we pay the least attention to when it comes to our instruction.  Kaput (2008) states, 
    "The heart of algebraic reasoning is comprised of complex symbolization processes that serve purposeful 
    generalizations and reasoning with generalizations".  Symbolization gives students the ability to organize 
    ideas into smaller visual space as compared to use of prose.  Beyond this, symbolization not only reasons 
    with existing ideas, but also <em>shapes</em> new ideas as they develop.  The symbols we use affect the way 
    we see reality and so algebra encompasses far more than the symbols used, but serve as a medium by which we 
    reason.  One of the most powerful aspects of mathematics is its symbolization; however, one of the biggest 
    obstacles of mathematics (from a learner standpoint) is it symbolization.  Students must be able to unpack 
    the symbols when using them to reason.  As Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno suggest, this happens when students are 
    given time to interact with the symbols (or even better, are allowed to create the symbols).  Just like 
    learning a language, we begin with translation between words until those words become so connected in our 
    mental schema that we can use them interchangeably.  As this process progresses, we move toward fluency.  The 
    same is true for mathematical language.  Students must be given the time to move back and forth between 
    the represented world and the world of symbols doing the representing.
