  <title>What Is Algebra?</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        In the preparation of secondary mathematics teachers, it is important to situate the content of algebra 
        within the overall mathematical education of the learner.  Where does algebra begin?  For quite a few 
        years, there has been a call for “algebra for all” in the eighth grade (Usiskin, 1987).  The Principles 
        and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM, 2000) and the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics 
        (CCSS-M) (NGACBP &amp; CCSSO, 2010) have an algebra strand that runs through the spectrum of the 
        curriculum from pre-Kindergarten through grade 12.  The traditional place for algebra has been at the 
        beginning of secondary school (usually at the ninth grade) for most students.  Why then, does NCTM and 
        others place algebra as a strand beginning in preschool education?  Here we will address two major 
        reasons that “algebra” is now being considered at lower grades: (1) our understanding about what 
        constitutes algebra has significantly changed over the last few decades and (2) the advent of newer 
        technologies has provided the opportunity for students to begin abstracting ideas at younger ages.

        <em>Algebraic Reasoning</em>

    <p>
        Within the traditional culture algebra has been viewed as the collection of symbol manipulations and 
        rules that govern them.  This can be seen by the remarks given by the student in the TIMSS excerpt 
        shared at the opening of this module.  Here the student states, “It's kind of a set in stone.  It's 
        procedure.  It's a formula.  You learn the formula and you know how to do math.”  This view of algebra 
        as a collection of letters on a page has often stood in the way of exposing younger students to 
        algebraic ideas because the feeling was that in order for students to do algebra, they must be able to 
        use letters to represent mathematical ideas.  Recent research; however, has suggested that younger 
        students might be capable of symbolizing mathematical ideas (Carraher, Schielmann, Brizuela, &amp; 
        Earnest, 2006).  But even if a student does not currently symbolize mathematical ideas in the 
        traditional “algebraic” sense, does that mean they are not doing algebra?  The basic assumption of the 
        CCSS-M and NCTM Standards is that algebraic ideas develop over time and that the ability to directly 
        symbolize is neither necessary nor sufficient to learn algebra.  As you recall from our discussion of 
        the Pirie and Kieren model for growth of mathematical understanding, the development of the concepts of 
        algebra take place on various levels and evolve as the learner participates in experiences that advance 
        the growth.  The student may still be doing algebra even though they are not directly manipulating symbols.

        To illustrate a young learner “doing” algebra, consider the following example from parenting experience.  
        When my son was in first grade, I had taken him and his sisters to a local fast food establishment.  
        At this particular restaurant, there was a children's area equipped with the standard network of “gerbil 
        tubes” for the children to climb through as they frequently took breaks from eating.  Now my son became 
        tired of climbing around and sat down next to me at the table to see what I was doing.  I had been 
        playing with my TI-89 calculator equipped with a computer algebra system (CAS) and he asked me to show 
        him what it would do.  I knew that in his classroom he was studying inequality and so I asked if he 
        wanted to play a game.  Being bored, he quickly said yes and so I explained the rules to a game I called, 
        “Guess My Number”.  The game is quite simple (as the name suggests) and so I told him that I would store 
        a number in the calculator and his job was to guess it by using only expressions of inequalities.  I 
        stored a number in the variable <m>z</m> as shown in <xref ref="fig-guess-number"/> and then cleared the 
        screen.  My son then tried to guess the number by entering an inequality and reading the response.  He 
        then proceeded to try other inequalities until he thought he could guess the number.  He thought this was 
        a fun game and so I stored another number in <m>z</m> and we started again.  My son was fascinated with 
        the idea that I could change <m>z</m> and play again.  Now this may not seem like algebra, but this 
        simple activity was building the concept of variable in a first grader.  It should also be noted that in 
        this simple game, the three main views of variable (<em>unknown quantity</em>, 
        <em>generalized quantity</em>, and <em>quantities in a functional relationship</em>) are all present.  
        This type of algebraic reasoning <em>is</em> mathematics.  The recognition of algebraic reasoning as a 
        significant part of algebra has prompted us to better characterize what younger students do in 
        mathematics and consider algebra a preK-12 endeavor.
