  <title>Inverses, Undoing, and the Role of Structure</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        As we examine the nature of algebra, we might begin by asking the question, "What is it good for?".  
        Think back to your early experiences with algebra in middle or high school.  What would you say was its 
        purpose?  You will likely recall spending a great deal of time solving equations.  In fact, much of the 
        processes and procedures that you spent substantial time mastering were in pursuit of solutions to 
        equations.  But how and why do these processes and procedures work?  To answer this question, we need to 
        examine the "structure" that <em>is</em> algebra.

          Suppose you wanted to solve the equation, <m>x+5=8</m>.  What processes would you use to solve it?  
          For each of the following stages of the solution process, provide a mathematical property that was 
          used to transform the equation to its new form.

    In <xref ref="act-additive-structure"/>, you identified mathematical properties at each stage of the solution 
    process.  But is there truly a "structure" to this process?  If so, can this structure be abstracted and 
    can it be used in other cases for solving equations?  Consider the following activity.

    Think back to when you first decided to become a secondary mathematics teacher.  Now recall your reaction 
    when you learned how much mathematics you had to take to complete the degree.  Often preservice mathematics 
    teachers contemplate entering the profession thinking, “Well, I've been through high school math so becoming 
    a math teacher shouldn't be too difficult.  After all, it only involves learning how to present the 
    mathematics I already know.”
  </p>

  <p>
    When listening to university students talking in the hallways, it is not uncommon to hear comments such as, 
    “Why do I have to take Abstract Algebra, I'm never going to teach this stuff to high school students?”  
    Lurking in the background is the assumption that they have a deep knowledge of the mathematics that makes up 
    the secondary curriculum.  Unfortunately, most high school students' perception of algebra involves symbol 
    manipulations and memorized formulae and algorithms.  In order to address the underlying structure of 
    mathematics, we will examine a basic skill that is taught in the secondary schools from an advanced standpoint.

  <title>The Concept of Inverse</title>

  <p>
    In order to begin a fruitful discussion of mathematical concepts and their relationship to teaching and 
    learning, it is helpful to first examine our own understanding of the concepts in question.  In this 
    particular section, we will investigate the concept of inverse function.  From a constructivist perspective, 
    no two people have exactly the same conceptual understanding of inverse function.  While there may be some 
    common definitions and representations used for describing this idea, not all people have the same mental 
    constructs and images that emerge when the term “inverse function” is mentioned.  The way in which other 
    mathematical ideas are connected to this concept may also be quite different depending on the person you 
    ask.  Here you will be asked to give some preliminary responses to questions and to build a concept map 
    showing your linkages among mathematical ideas.
  </p>

  <p>
    <activity xml:id="act-inverse-concept-initial">

        <p>
          We begin by reflecting on our own understanding of inverse.  In your own words, respond to the 
          following questions with respect to your current conception of "inverse function".

      </introduction>
      <task>

            Imagine yourself in your first teaching position where you have to teach students about inverse 
            functions, how would you teach it?  How is it connected to other mathematics they have learned (i.e. 
            what would Pirie &amp; Kieren give as the <em>primitive knowing</em> for expanding the concept of 
            inverse function)?

  <p>
    One of the ways in which we advance our thinking is through reflection.  In 
    <xref ref="act-inverse-concept-initial"/>, you began by describing your understanding of a concept.  At this 
    point it is important to reflect on your responses and try to articulate your understanding in greater 
    detail.  To accomplish this task, we will use a concept map to pull your mental constructs together and 
    prompt you to reflect on your own understanding.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          A concept map is like a flow chart; however, there is not necessarily a linear flow of ideas.  Instead, 
          it is often the case that the concept map resembles more of a web with concepts connected in a variety 
          of ways.  <xref ref="fig-sample-concept-map"/> gives a sample of a concept map constructed by a student 
          showing relationships within concepts from a Linear Algebra course.  The main aspects of the maps are 
          the concept (usually encased in a bubble) and segments or directed line segments showing how the 
          concepts are connected.  In some cases, the connections are bidirectional; in others they may only go 
          one way.  These connections usually have words or symbols written along them to explain how the person 
          views the connection between the two concepts.
