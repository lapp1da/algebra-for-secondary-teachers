  <title>Inverses, Undoing, and the Role of Structure</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        As we examine the nature of algebra, we might begin by asking the question, "What is it good for?".  
        Think back to your early experiences with algebra in middle or high school.  What would you say was its 
        purpose?  You will likely recall spending a great deal of time solving equations.  In fact, much of the 
        processes and procedures that you spent substantial time mastering were in pursuit of solutions to 
        equations.  But how and why do these processes and procedures work?  To answer this question, we need to 
        examine the "structure" that <em>is</em> algebra.

          Suppose you wanted to solve the equation, <m>x+5=8</m>.  What processes would you use to solve it?  
          For each of the following stages of the solution process, provide a mathematical property that was 
          used to transform the equation to its new form.

    In <xref ref="act-additive-structure"/>, you identified mathematical properties at each stage of the solution 
    process.  But is there truly a "structure" to this process?  If so, can this structure be abstracted and 
    can it be used in other cases for solving equations?  Consider the following activity.

    The properties that you just noticed in trying to solve the equations in <xref ref="act-additive-structure"/> 
    and <xref ref="act-multiplicative-structure"/> are the basic and essential properties that are required to 
    solve an equation that uses only one binary operation.  For this reason, it should come as no surprise that 
    the most basic structure we define in algebra is composed of these properties.  We call a structure that has 
    these four properties a <em>group</em> and we will spend some time looking at the behavior of groups and 
    examine how these structures are actually taught in the secondary algebra curriculum.

        </p>
        <p>

    Think back to when you first decided to become a secondary mathematics teacher.  Now recall your reaction 
    when you learned how much mathematics you had to take to complete the degree.  Often preservice mathematics 
    teachers contemplate entering the profession thinking, “Well, I've been through high school math so becoming 
    a math teacher shouldn't be too difficult.  After all, it only involves learning how to present the 
    mathematics I already know.”
  </p>

  <p>
    When listening to university students talking in the hallways, it is not uncommon to hear comments such as, 
    “Why do I have to take Abstract Algebra, I'm never going to teach this stuff to high school students?”  
    Lurking in the background is the assumption that they have a deep knowledge of the mathematics that makes up 
    the secondary curriculum.  Unfortunately, most high school students' perception of algebra involves symbol 
    manipulations and memorized formulae and algorithms.  In order to address the underlying structure of 
    mathematics, we will examine a basic skill that is taught in the secondary schools from an advanced standpoint.

  <title>The Concept of Inverse: Setting the Stage</title>

  <p>
    In order to begin a fruitful discussion of mathematical concepts and their relationship to teaching and 
    learning, it is helpful to first examine our own understanding of the concepts in question.  In this 
    particular section, we will investigate the concept of inverse function.  From a constructivist perspective, 
    no two people have exactly the same conceptual understanding of inverse function.  While there may be some 
    common definitions and representations used for describing this idea, not all people have the same mental 
    constructs and images that emerge when the term “inverse function” is mentioned.  The way in which other 
    mathematical ideas are connected to this concept may also be quite different depending on the person you 
    ask.  Here you will be asked to give some preliminary responses to questions and to build a concept map 
    showing your linkages among mathematical ideas.

          We begin by reflecting on our own understanding of inverse.  In your own words, respond to the 
          following questions with respect to your current conception of "inverse function".

            Imagine yourself in your first teaching position where you have to teach students about inverse 
            functions, how would you teach it?  How is it connected to other mathematics they have learned (i.e. 
            what would Pirie &amp; Kieren give as the <em>primitive knowing</em> for expanding the concept of 
            inverse function)?

    One of the ways in which we advance our thinking is through reflection.  In 
    <xref ref="act-inverse-concept-initial"/>, you began by describing your understanding of a concept.  At this 
    point it is important to reflect on your responses and try to articulate your understanding in greater 
    detail.  To accomplish this task, we will use a concept map to pull your mental constructs together and 
    prompt you to reflect on your own understanding.

          A concept map is like a flow chart; however, there is not necessarily a linear flow of ideas.  Instead, 
          it is often the case that the concept map resembles more of a web with concepts connected in a variety 
          of ways.  <xref ref="fig-sample-concept-map"/> gives a sample of a concept map constructed by a student 
          showing relationships within concepts from a Linear Algebra course.  The main aspects of the maps are 
          the concept (usually encased in a bubble) and segments or directed line segments showing how the 
          concepts are connected.  In some cases, the connections are bidirectional; in others they may only go 
          one way.  These connections usually have words or symbols written along them to explain how the person 
          views the connection between the two concepts.

      <title>Inverse Functions: The Case of Tim</title>
      
      
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Tim is a beginning teacher in his second year.  Today, he is teaching the concept of inverse function.  
          To find an inverse function, the text that Tim is using begins by having the students swap the 
          variables of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> and then solve for <m>y</m>.  He is fairly confident that he can 
          teach his students how to use this procedure to find inverse functions, but also noted that the book 
          has students check to see if the inverse function works by composing the two functions to see if the 
          composition results in “x”.  Tim also noticed that the book covers function composition in the section 
          before inverse function and assumes this is so that students can understand how to check their answers 
          once they have found the inverse function.  Since he wants to be sure the students are ready, he begins 
          class by discussing the previous day's lesson on function composition.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Tim</em> : OK, let's make sure we understand what we did yesterday since we are going to use it 
          today.  What is composition of functions?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Jen</em> : Isn't it just sticking one thing into another?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Tim</em> : Yes, it is.  Can anyone show us how to do it?  [<em>Lori raises her hand</em>].  Lori, 
          go to the board.  Can anyone give us two functions?  [<em>Ken raises his hand</em>].  Ken, whatcha got?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Ken</em> : How about <m>f\left(x\right)=3x-1</m> and <m>g\left(x\right)=x^2+x</m>?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Tim</em> : Great.  Now Lori, show us what to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Lori</em> : OK, I guess it depends on what order you want.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Tim</em> : Let's do <m>f\left(g\left(x\right)\right)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Lori</em> : So we just take <m>x^2+x</m> and stick it in for <m>x</m> in <m>3x-1</m>.  That gives 
          us <m>3\left(x^2+x\right)-1</m>.  Now we can just distribute it out and that gives us <m>3x^2+3x-1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Tim</em> : Super!  Is everyone OK with that?  [<em>The class is quiet</em>].  Good, let's move on 
          to today's stuff.  Thanks, Lori.  [<em>Lori sits down</em>].
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Tim</em> : Today we're going to look at inverses when it comes to functions.  Has anyone ever heard 
          the word “inverse” before?  [<em>Several hands go up</em>].  Yeah, Mia.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Mia</em> : Wouldn't that just be like the flip of a function?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Tim</em> : [<em>Smiles</em>].  No, that's a common mistake.  This is completely different when it 
          comes to functions.  Let's look at the book's way of finding inverse functions.  In pairs, take a 
          couple of minutes to read the procedure on page 213 (see <xref ref="fig-tim-text-inverse-function"/>).

        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Tim</em> : Mike, in your own words explain how to find inverse functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Mike</em> : Well, first you just switch the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>s.  Then you just solve for 
          <m>y</m> so that <m>y</m> is on one side of the equation and the other side just has <m>x</m>s.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Tim</em> : Very good.  Let's do one together.  Let's start with lines.  How about the function we 
          used earlier, <m>y=3x-1</m>.  Tell me what to do.  Yeah, Joan, get us started.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Joan</em> : First write it as <m>x=3y-1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Tim</em> : Now what?  Someone else [<em>Hiro raises his hand</em>].  Hiro go ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Hiro</em> : Just add 1 to both sides to get <m>x+1=3y</m>.  The only thing we have to do now is 
          divide by 3 so we get <m>y</m> all by itself.  That gives us <m>y=\frac{x+1}{3}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Tim</em> : Excellent.  Does everyone see how it's done?  [<em>Kat raises her hand</em>].  Yeah, Kat.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Kat</em> : How do we know it's the inverse function?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Tim</em> : I'm glad you asked that, Kat.  That's our next part of the lesson.  To see if it worked, 
          we just think of these as functions and compose them like we did yesterday.  If we get “x”, then they 
          are inverses.  Let's try it.  OK, let's make <m>f\left(x\right)=3x-1</m> like we did before and now 
          make <m>g\left(x\right)=\frac{x+1}{3}</m>.  Sue, come to the board and work out this composition.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Sue</em> : [<em>Sue goes to the board and begins writing.</em>]  OK, we have 
          <m>f\left(g\left(x\right)\right)</m>.  That gives <m>3\left(\frac{x+1}{3}\right)-1</m>.  We can cancel the 
          3s and that leaves just <m>x+1</m> and <m>-1</m>.  The 1 and -1 cancel and we get <m>x</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Tim</em> : Great.  Do you see, Kat?  Since we got <m>x</m> that means they're inverses.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Kat</em> : I'm still not sure how you know they're inverses?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Tim</em> : Well, we got <m>x</m>.  If you compose a function and its inverse you get <m>x</m>.  
          Let's do a few more and that might help with remembering it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Kat</em> : But why do we get <m>x</m>?  Why don't we get 1?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Tim</em> : That's just the definition of what it means to be an inverse function.  Just follow 
          these steps and you'll be OK.

    Now that we have started to reflect on our own experiences with inverses, we need to spend a little time 
    exploring inverses beyond the elementary operations of addition and multiplication.  While these early 
    experiences ground us in similar patterns of behavior of sets of numbers with each operation, we need to 
    branch out to other sets of object and operations in order to begin to abstract these behaviors and not 
    worry about the context in which they live.  After all, Poincaré expressed this so well.
  </p>
  <p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>Mathematicians do not study objects, but relations among objects; they are indifferent to the 
        replacement of objects by others as long as relations do not change. Matter is not important, only form 
        interests them. — Henri Poincaré</em>.

  <p>
    As we saw in Tim's class from <xref ref="act-inverse-functions-case-of-tim"/>, Kat was frustrated by the 
    response she received from Tim when her expectation of obtaining a 1 when composing a function and its 
    inverse did not occur.  In addition to this, Mia tried to explain her understanding of inverse by stating, 
    "Wouldn't that just be like the flip of a function?".  To which Tim smiled and responded, "No, that's a 
    common mistake.  This is completely different when it comes to functions."  Instead of taking these two 
    responses and noticing the commonality (both students seemed to be thinking of multiplication as the 
    operation), Tim shut them down as if what they are about to learn with respect to inverse functions is a new 
    concept.  Pirie &amp; Kieren would see the students' responses as an opportunity to fold back to more 
    familiar sets and operations where the students have comfort and build toward abstraction by prompting the 
    learner to explore the underlying structure inherent in the behavior common to addition, multiplication, and 
    function composition.  To help us frame our discussion, let's take a little mathematical detour and explore 
    the same structure we noticed before we defined a <em>group</em>.  Only this time, we will use sets of 
    functions and our operation will be <em>function composition</em>, <m>\circ</m>.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          This activity explores basic concepts of algebra including properties of algebraic structure.  In 
          high school, the primary operations used in algebra were multiplication and addition.  Are these the 
          only types of operations that can be used?  We will explore this question and look for patterns that 
          are common across algebra.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recall that in your experiences in elementary school, you first learned to operate on the set of 
          integers, <m>\left\{\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \right\}</m>, using a simple operation, 
          addition.  When this set was combined with the operation of addition, certain properties held.  Some 
          of these properties included: <em>closure</em>, <em>associativity</em>, the existence of an 
          <em>identity</em> element, and <em>inverses</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the set of functions, <m>T=\left\{e, f, g, h, j, k\right\}</m>, where the functions are 
          defined as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>
            e\left(x\right)=x, f\left(x\right)=\frac{1}{x}, g\left(x\right)=\frac{x}{x-1}, h\left(x\right)=1-x, 
            j\left(x\right)=\frac{1}{1-x}, k\left(x\right)=\frac{x-1}{x}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Mathematics can be described as the study of patterns.  For this reason, we often look for similar 
          structure in both nature and mathematical systems.  Mathematics can certainly be used to study patterns 
          in the physical world, but we can also look for patterns within mathematics itself.  Are there times 
          when one mathematical system is, for all practical purposes, “identical” to another mathematical system 
          and therefore governed by the same properties and relationships?  If this is so, then one system can 
          give us quite a bit of information about another system.  In fact, if one system is easier to operate 
          on, we can use it instead and then deduce information about the other system without having to do more 
          difficult computations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this activity, we will explore what properties exist when pairing the set <m>T</m> above with the 
          operation of composition of functions, <m>\left(T,\circ \right)</m>.  As you explore this set, try to 
          keep your eyes open for patterns in the relationships among functions.  Some properties you may want 
          to check might include: closure, associativity, identity, inverses, and commutativity. For example, 
          consider your experience with basic arithmetic.  For addition on the set of integers, the set is closed 
          since adding two integers always results in another integer.  The number 0 acts as an identity (i.e. 
          <m>a+0=0+a=a</m>, leaving other elements unchanged) and 5 and -5 are inverses of each other (i.e. 
          <m>5+^{-}5=0</m>, where combining them yields 0, the identity).  This type of structure is very 
          important for deducing mathematical truths within a mathematical system.
        </p>

        <p>
          To begin, we define the functions above on your computer algebra system.  This has already been done 
          for you on page 1.1 of the TI-Nspire CAS document.  Once the functions are defined, build an operation 
          table (called a Cayley table) for the composition of functions of the form <m>A \circ B</m> in the 
          space below by simply entering compositions such as 
          <m>f\left(g\left(x\right)\right)=\frac{x-1}{x}=k\left(x\right)</m> and recording the result in the 
          table as shown.  This can be done more efficiently by first entering the functions in a spreadsheet 
          (see page 1.2 of the <em>FormFunction.tns</em> file) and naming the entire set of functions “funset” 
          and then performing compositions on the entire set all at once either on the <em>Calculator</em> page 
          or in the <em>Lists &amp; Spreadsheets</em> page (see <xref ref="fig-compose-functions-cas"/>).  If you 
          use the spreadsheet, note that the columns in the spreadsheet correspond to rows in the table you are 
          filling in due to the way the same operation is performed for an entire column in the spreadsheet.  
          This syntax is similar to Microsoft Excel [i.e. by typing <m>\mathbf{=f(funset)}</m>].

            C\left(j\right) \cap C\left(k\right)=\bigcap\limits_{a \in T} C\left(a\right)</m>.  Since each of 
            these elements must commute with each and every element of <m>T</m> in order to be in the 
            intersection, we call this special set of elements that commute with each other the 
            <em>center of</em> <m>T</m> and denote it by <m>Z\left(T\right)</m>.

            What do you think would happen if we composed a function not found in a specific subgroup with 
            each element in that subgroup?  To investigate this question, pick one of the subgroups generated 
            in a column from part (k) and compose it with a function not in the subgroup.  For example, using 
            the subgroup <m>\langle k \rangle=kord=\left\{e,j,k\right\}</m> and composing the elements with, 
            say <m>f</m>, we get the new set as shown below. This subset formed by composing <m>f</m> with

            At this point our observations about the partitioning of a group into subsets is based solely on 
            one example of a group.  To test your conjectures, first confirm that the following set, <m>S</m>, 
            of matrices forms a group under the operation of regular matrix multiplication.  To do this, first 
            insert a new problem by pressing <c>doc</c> and selecting <m>\mathbf{Insert}</m> and then 
            <m>\mathbf{Problem}</m>.   After selecting a <em>Calculator</em> page, use the <em>Define</em>

            entered simply as <m>a\cdot b</m> on the CAS.  Now create subgroups of the set by raising each 
            element to increasing powers until you reach the identity, then repeat the process from parts (o) 
            and (p) to see if the group of matrices is partitioned in a similar manner as was the set <m>T</m> 
            by sketching and circling subsets.

            Using the evidence from your diagrams, give an argument for why the order of an element must divide 
            the order of the group.  Given that your argument is based on only a few cases of evidence 
            (namely the sets <m>T</m> and <m>S</m> with various subgroups), what main properties would you need 
            to show in order to prove your claim in general?

  <p>
    So what are the takeaways from this investigation, specifically for this particular set and operation, as well as 
    for general structures that have the properties of groups?  Well, let's consider the observations you hopefully 
    noticed in the exploration.  We can summarize four main ideas here.
  </p>

  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          From part (k), the order (or size) of the subgroups were either 1, 2, or 3.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          From part (n), all cosets were the same size as the subroup that generated the coset.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          From part (p), cosets generated by a given subgroup are either completely identical or completely disjoint.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          From part (p), all elements of the group occur in exactly one coset, disregarding repeated cosets (i.e. no 
          stragglers lurking outside a coset).
        </p>
      </li>
      
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    The result of these observations is that the group gets chopped up into disjoint subsets (cosets) all having the 
    same number of elements in them.  Since the cosets all have the same size as the subgroup used to generate them, 
    this means that the size (or order) of the subgroup must divide the order of the original group.  Hence since our 
    group of functions had order 6, we should only expect a subgroup to have an order that is a divisor of 6.  Again, 
    as you noticed in part (k), the sizes of the subgroups were 1, 2, or 3 (all divisors of 6).  We can't have a 
    subgroup of, say order 5, if our group is of order 6 since 5 does not divide 6.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have observed these patterns in the activity <xref ref="act-form-function"/>, but will this hold for all groups?  
    In order to be certain, we need to prove it for all groups based on the basic properties of groups.  Let's start by 
    trying to argue these observations a little at a time.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the key parts of the argument deals with having all cosets being of the same "size" (actually the size of 
    the subgroup that generated the coset).  To establish that this was not just a fluke in our activity, we need to 
    consider what would happen if cosets were not the same size as the subgroup that gave birth to them.
  </p>

  <p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-same-size-cosets">
      <title>Coset "Size"</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A left (or right) coset in a finite group contains the same number of elements as the subgroup that generated 
          the coset.
        </p>

            Suppose <m>H \lt G</m> (i.e. <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>).  Further, let 
            <m>H=\left\{h_1, h_2, h_3, \ldots, h_m\right\}</m>.  Now we can form a left coset, <m>aH</m>, such that 
            <m>aH=\left\{ah_1, ah_2, ah_3, \ldots, ah_m\right\}</m>.  We can claim that all elements of this coset 
            are unique since if not, we must have that <m>ah_i=ah_j</m>, for some <m>i</m> and <m>j</m> with 
            <m>i \neq j</m>.  But this would mean that <m>a^{-1}ah_i=a^{-1}ah_j \Rightarrow</m> 
            <m>eh_i=eh_j</m>, and thus <m>h_i=h_j</m> and so <m>ah_i \neq ah_j</m>.

    The next observation that we made in <xref ref="act-form-function"/> was that if we put all of the cosets together, 
    we ended up with the entire group (as evidenced in your diagrams of cosets).

    <theorem xml:id="thm-union-cosets">
      <title>Union of Cosets is the Group</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>H</m> be a subgroup of a group <m>G</m>.  Then the union of all left cosets of <m>H</m> gives the 
          entire group <m>G</m>.  In other words, <m>G=\bigcup\limits_{a \in G}aH</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
        <p>
          Since every left coset consists of elements from <m>G</m>, then <m>ah \in G</m> for all <m>a \in G</m> and 
          <m>h \in H</m>.  Therefore, we have <m>\bigcup\limits_{a \in G}aH \subseteq G</m>.  Now, if <m>b \in G</m> and 
          since <m>e \in H</m>, we can see that every element of <m>G</m> can be found in its respective coset, <m>bH</m>, 
          since <m>b=be \in bH</m>.  Since <m>b \in G</m>, then <m>bH \subseteq \bigcup\limits_{a \in G}aH</m> and thus, 
          every element in <m>G</m> is also in <m>\bigcup\limits_{a \in G}aH</m>.  Therefore, 
          <m>G \subseteq \bigcup\limits_{a \in G}aH</m>.  Since <m>\bigcup\limits_{a \in G}aH \subseteq G</m> and 
          <m>G \subseteq \bigcup\limits_{a \in G}aH</m>, we have that <m>G=\bigcup\limits_{a \in G}aH</m>.  Note that 
          this proof also works for right cosets.

    The significance of this theorem is that a group can be formed by the union of all of its left (or right) cosets.  
    But, could some of these cosets overlap in some way?  If so, how can the elements from one coset overlap with 
    another?  Are there any restrictions on the overlap?  You will recall experiencing this partitioning in 
    <xref ref="act-form-function"/> lab when you placed boundaries around the subsets from <m>T</m> that you found as a 
    result of composing subgroups with elements from the set <m>T</m>.  You will also recall from the activity that the 
    subsets (cosets) did not appear to overlap once you placed the boundaries around them.  Put another way, the subsets 
    generated in the activity either had no elements in common or were identical.  While our experiences have suggested 
    that there is no overlap, we do need to address this issue of possible overlap from a more formal and absolute sense.  
    Consider the following theorem.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose <m>c \in aH</m> and <m>c \in bH</m>.  This means that <m>c=ah_1=bh_2</m> for some 
            <m>h_1, h_2 \in H</m>.  Then we must also have that <m>a=bh_2h^{-1}_1</m>.  This implies that for any 
            <m>h_3 \in H</m>, we can express <m>ah_3=\left(bh_2h^{-1}_1\right)h_3=b\left(h_2h^{-1}_1b_3\right)=bh_4</m> 
            for some <m>h_4 \in H</m> since <m>H</m> is closed.  From this we can say that <m>ah_3=bh_4 \in bH</m> and 
            thus every element in <m>aH</m> is also in <m>bH</m> implying <m>aH \subseteq bH</m>.  By a similar 
            argument, we also get that <m>bH \subseteq aH</m>, thus <m>aH=bH</m>.

    We now have everything we need to address the observation that you made from <xref ref="act-form-function"/>.  
    Recall that when you examined the “powers” of the function composition in the activity, there was an interesting 
    observation made, namely, the orders of the elements (functions in this case) seemed to be a divisor of the order of 
    the group.  This brings us to a classic theorem known as <em>LaGrange's theorem</em>.

    Now that we have spent some time exploring basic properties in algebra through 
    <xref ref="act-form-function"/>, we can start to examine how these structures relate to the secondary curriculum and 
    how we can engage students in doing more than mimicking symbol manipulation without an understanding of 
    the meaning behind the manipulation.  As you discovered earlier, the most basic of structure in algebra is 
    the <em>group</em> since the properties of a group are the minimal needed for use in solving an equation that uses 
    only one operation.  Let's now dig a little deeper into these ideas.
  </p>

</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-algebraic-structure-digging-deeper">
  <title>Algebraic Structure: Digging Deeper</title>
  <p>
    In order to address the underlying structure of mathematics, we will examine a basic skill that is taught 
    in the secondary schools from an advanced standpoint.  At this point, it is assumed that the reader has 
    experienced the corresponding parts of this text including the activity 
    <xref ref="act-form-function"/> as well as the portions of the <em>Interactive Mathematics Program</em> 
    (IMP) titled, <em>Functions in Verse</em>, <em>Linear Functions in Verse</em>, 
    <em>An Inventory of Inverses</em>, and the Supplemental Problem, <em>Its Own Inverse</em>.  In addition, 
    it is also assumed that the reader has discussed the vignette, <em>Inverse Functions: The Case of Tim</em> 
    (<xref ref="act-inverse-functions-case-of-tim"/>).  These activities and curriculum materials are essential 
    to give the reader a point of reference for this mathematical discussion on algebraic structure.
  </p>

  <p>
    <m>\mathbf{Operations}</m> <m>\mathbf{and}</m> <m>\mathbf{Their}</m> <m>\mathbf{Representations}</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    Before we begin an examination of algebraic structure and its relationship to the secondary curriculum, we 
    first need to think about the basic components that make up different types of algebraic structures.  
    Generally, when we think about algebra, be it at the secondary or undergraduate level, we have two basic 
    components—a <em>set</em> and an <em>operation</em> or <em>operations</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may recall from your high school experience a great deal of time spent simplifying or solving 
    expressions or equations that involved primarily the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
    and division.  In these cases, the operations were <em>binary</em> meaning that they took two elements in a 
    set (say the real numbers) and returned another element from the same set.  While the result of a binary 
    operation does not have to be from the same set as the inputs, we will restrict our discussion to this case 
    since it is the most familiar.  For example, <m>2+3=5</m> takes the two numbers 2 and 3 and returns the 
    number 5.  Similarly with multiplication, <m>2 \cdot 3=6</m> takes the two numbers 2 and 3 and returns the 
    number 6.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although arithmetic operations are the basis of many people's experience within the school setting, we can 
    also think about non-arithmetic operations.  Recall from your experiences in the activity, 
    <em>Form and Function</em>, we used the operation of function composition.  If you have ever worked a puzzle 
    called <em>Rubik's Cube</em>, you have performed other non-arithmetic operations.  In this case you can describe 
    clockwise rotations of various faces as well as a myriad of other moves that transform the cube from one 
    state to another.  As we will see, whether we use arithmetic operations or non-arithmetic ones, there is an 
    underlying structure that becomes evident as we notice patterns of behavior for elements of the set with 
    which the operations are associated.
  </p>

  <p>
    <m>\mathbf{Solving}</m> <m>\mathbf{Basic}</m> <m>\mathbf{Equations}</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    When we examine the solutions to basic equations, we notice a similar structure that occurs in all processes 
    regardless of the binary operation being used.  If we consider the solution to the equation <m>a*x=b</m> for any 
    binary operation, <m>*</m>, the process used to find the solution is the same no matter what operation we choose.  
    However, in order to use this process, there are some underlying assumptions that need to be stated.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recall in <xref ref="act-additive-structure"/> and <xref ref="act-multiplicative-structure"/> we determined the 
    minimal properties needed to be able to solve an equation in one operation.  These properties were what we used to 
    define the most basic of algebraic structures, a <em>group</em> (see <xref ref="def-group"/>).  If we examined the 
    steps used in the solution of each of these equations, we will noticed that the statements of properties and 
    definitions as well as the order in which they were applied were identical.  In fact, when I was writing these 
    portions of the text, I simply copied and pasted the first solution into the document and then replaced all of the 
    "<m>+</m> operations with “<m>\cdot</m>" and then all of the instances of "<m>-a</m>" were replaced with 
    "<m>\frac{1}{a}</m>".  When we think about writing this section of the text in this way, the algebraic structure 
    becomes very clear.
  </p>

  <p>
    <m>\mathbf{Operations}</m> <m>\mathbf{and}</m> <m>\mathbf{Functions}</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to study algebraic structure, we need to first consider the basic components that make up that structure.  
    As we stated before, generally we think of sets and operations as the building blocks of an algebraic system.  Young 
    children become familiar with the concept of set from a very early age through the use of physical manipulatives, 
    but what about operations?  How do children view operations?  One might argue that many children see arithmetic 
    operations as physical actions that operate on sets of objects.  After all, early development of the addition 
    concept involves combining sets of objects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Others might argue that many children see operations as a series of procedures to be performed using pencil and 
    paper.  Traditionally, in elementary school, a great deal of time is devoted to memorizing “addition facts” and 
    “multiplication tables”.  Of course, from a traditional point of view, knowing addition and multiplication facts is 
    essential for mastery of the algorithms that follow.  One goal of our existing curriculum is to enable students to 
    compute sums and products efficiently and accurately.  However, after observing children working on problems within 
    a context, we have begun to question whether or not they make the connection between the earlier physical operations 
    on sets and the arithmetic operations on numbers.  In many cases, a child will be able to perform computations such 
    as <m>427 \div 3</m> while at the same time struggle with a problem like:
  </p>

  <p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Sue, Jan, and Amanda put equal amounts of money together and bought a large tub of candy containing 427 pieces.  
        If they agree to split the candy equally, how many pieces does each get?  Are there any pieces left over?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
  </p>

  <p>
    In many instances, the child is able to do the computation when posed simply as, <m>427 \div 3=</m>, but does not 
    necessarily have a conceptual understanding of what the quotient, remainder, or divisor represent.  This disconnect 
    between conceptual meaning and algorithmic procedure is concerning since in order to apply mathematical processes to 
    real-world problems, the student must first understand what the process means so that it will be applied in an 
    appropriate situation.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, in my early years of teaching, I has an experience teaching algebraic concepts related to distance, 
    rate, and time.  I asked a student the question, “If you drive at 55 mph for two hours, how far have you traveled?”  
    Upon first consideration, the student simply looked puzzled.  In response, thinking the student was having trouble 
    doubling 55, I changed the problem by saying, “Suppose you drive at 60 mph for two hours, how far have you traveled?”
    <m>-</m> I thought doubling 6 might be easier.  The student replied, “Three miles.”  What was the student doing?  
    Upon further probing, it turns out that the student was simply dividing 60 by 2 (incorrectly) because he had been 
    taught that you “divide when you have distance, rate, and time problems.”  It comes as little surprise that this 
    same student when posed with a new problem and asked how he might solve it responded, “Add…, no subtract…, no 
    divide.”  After uttering each response, he would watch my face looking for cues as to which operation was correct. 
    I referred to this student approach as the “random operator generator”.  It is important to note that this student 
    was fairly proficient at computing with pencil and paper algorithms.  The bottom line is that this student had very 
    weak (if not nonexistent) connections between algorithmic procedures and conceptual understanding of the operations 
    in question.  If unable to make conceptual connections, there is very little chance that the student will be able to 
    solve mathematical problems.  So what good is computational proficiency, if the student does not know when it is 
    appropriate to employ a certain type of computation?
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Functions, Mappings, and Binary Operations</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    As we think about teaching children operations and the algebraic properties that are associated with them, it is 
    helpful to put ourselves in the same unfamiliar position as our students by considering operations that are not 
    familiar to us.  But how do we create operations other than addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division?  
    We could use operations from linear algebra where properties such as commutativity are no longer assumed.  However, 
    we can also create our own operations that are combinations of familiar ones.  Once created, we can then investigate 
    properties and even attempt to solve equations that use the operation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suppose we want to explore a binary operation, call it <m>*</m>, on the set of real numbers defined by 
    <m>a*b=a+b-a\cdot b</m> where "<m>+</m>" and "<m>\cdot</m>" are the familiar operations of addition and 
    multiplication.  It would be nice if we could define this operation and then explore it using technology.  In order 
    to do this, let's first consider viewing a binary operation in a different way.  As we discussed earlier, a binary 
    operation takes two inputs, in this case from the set of real numbers, and yields a result that it also a real 
    number.  In algebra, we have seen another construct that also behaves in this manner (especially if we thinking back 
    to Calculus 3).  In a sense, a function takes inputs and produces outputs associated by the function rule.  In this 
    situation we want two inputs to yield a single output and so we can use a function of two variables.  Here we can 
    let a function, call it <m>\varphi</m>, be defined such that 
    <m>\varphi : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</m> and 
    <m>\varphi : \left(a,b\right) \mapsto a+b-a\cdot b</m>.  In this case, <m>\varphi \left(a,b\right)</m> acts like the 
    binary operation <m>a*b</m>.  The advantage of using a function approach to representing a binary operation is that 
    we can use it to define the operation on a computer algebra system (CAS) and then explore the properties of 
    “<m>*</m>” via the symbol manipulation capabilities of the CAS.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          In this activity, we will explore a binary operation for which we have little intuition.  This will allow us 
          to focus on the meaning of algebraic properties more deeply since we cannot use our "common knowledge" to 
          skip over how objects in a set (like the real numbers or integers) behave because we are too familiar with 
          their behavior.

          To begin, we are going to define the binary operation, <m>*</m>, that was describe above on our CAS so that

          two variables calling it <m>op\left(a,b\right)=a+b-a \cdot b</m> as shown below.

        Consider the operation <m>*</m> given by <m>a*b=\text{max} \left(a,b\right)</m>.  Verify or refute the following 
        properties.  Assume the set under this operation is the set of real numbers.  You may need to decide to restrict 
        the set based on what you discover regarding the operation and its relationship to the properties.  If so, 
        please explain your reasoning for the restriction.

        Suppose that <m>G</m> is a <em>cyclic</em> group.  Explain why it must therefore be <em>abelian</em>.  Note 
        that if a group is cyclic, there must be at least one <em>generator</em> (i.e. an element for which all 
        elements in <m>G</m> can be expressed as a power of it).
