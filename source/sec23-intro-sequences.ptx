  <title>Introduction to Sequences</title>
<introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec12-ccss-overview"/>, we looked at the CCSS and noted that young learners tended 
      be adept at analyzing patterns.  Sequences are a type of pattern that can take on many representations and 
      can allow for various approaches by students for analyzing and solving them.  For this reason, this 
      section will examine how students see sequences from both a mathematical and pedagogical perspective.  
      While there are many different kinds of sequences, we will focus primarily on arithmetic, geometric, 
      figurative, and recursive sequences.  We will ground our discussion in some classroom excerpts where 
      students are grappling with patterns and also address how the students begin to represent these patterns 
      and the effect this has on their thinking.  To begin, we should define what we mean by a sequence.

            A <em>sequence</em> is a list of terms <m>a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots</m>, given in a specific order.  
            These sequenced values can also be thought of as a function of the term number, <m>n</m>, and 
            denoted as <m>a_n</m>.  For the practical use of a computer algebra system, we often express the 
            terms using function notation, <m>a\left(n\right)</m>, so that we can define it in the CAS and 
            operate on its terms.  To express the entire sequence we often use the notation, 
            <m>\left \{a_n \right \}</m>, since we can think of the entire sequence as a list such as 
            <m>\left \{a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\right \}</m>.

    To begin, consider <em>The Border Problem: Part 1</em> found in <em>Connecting Mathematical Ideas: 
    Middle School Video Cases to Support Teaching and Learning (2005)</em> by Jo Boaler and Cathy Humphreys.  
    In this video case, students are exploring the pattern for finding the number of small shaded squares along 
    the outer edge of a larger <m>10 \times 10</m> square as seen in <xref ref="fig-border-10-10"/>.

          Watch the classroom episode of Cathy Humphreys' 7th grade class working on ways to find the border 
          of a square grid.  This video is found in the book, <em>Connecting Mathematical Ideas: Middle School

            The teacher, Cathy, in the episode allows for several different students to explain their way of 
            determining the total number of squares and she writes their method on the board with numerical 
            representations that align with the method.  For example, Sharmeen shares her thinking, "Well, first 
            I started out with forty from ten times four and then I subtracted four from that because there would 
            be four squares overlapping, and so that got thirty-six.".  Here Cathy writes on the board 
            <m>4 \times 10 -4</m>.  At this point, Cathy asks the questions, "And the four was for ...?", and 
            "OK. And this four was for?".  Discuss in your groups why you think Cathy chose this move in the 
            lesson?  From an algebraic standpoint, what is she trying to set up for later discussion?

      <task>

            Cathy then asks Colin to go up to the front and show his method.  Colin shares, "Anyway, so I, like, 
            I know this side is ten so I just did like ten and then this one, this one's the overlapping one, so 
            then this would be nine, then this one would be nine, too, because this one's overlapping. And then 
            for this, one it'd be eight because these two, this one is being used by this one and this one is 
            being used by that one."  As Colin explains, Cathy writes on the board, <m>10+9+9+8</m>.  In looking 
            at Sharmeen's and Colin's representations, how do you see them as the same?  How are they different?  
            Is there a way to move from one to the other in a way that makes <em>physical</em> sense?

            Toward the end of the lesson, Cathy asks the students to imagine shrinking the <m>10 \times 10</m> 
            square into a <m>6 \times 6</m> square.  She then asks them to use whatever method they want from 
            those previously discussed to determine the number of border square in the <m>6 \times 6</m> square.  
            In your groups, discuss why you think Cathy asked this question and where you think she is going with 
            this task?

    Now that we have speculated about Cathy's plan for her class, let's see where she takes the discussion on the 
    next day.  In the next activity, pay attention to the way Cathy tries to draw connections between the 
    physical representations of border squares and the way the computations are taking place.

            In the episode, Cathy asks the question, "What's staying the same in this arithmetic?".  Here Cathy is 
            using the expression, <m>10+10+8+8</m>. In your groups, discuss why you think Cathy is asking this 
            question?  What is she trying to accomplish with this question with respect to Kaput, Blanton, and 
            Moreno's model?

              In looking at Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno (see <xref ref="fig-kaput-blanton-moreno"/>), how do 
              learners transition to new representation systems?

            At this stage of the discussion, Sarah responds by saying, "Well, the first two numbers are the same 
            numbers and the last two numbers are the same numbers.".  Cathy then has the students work in their 
            groups to try and find a way to represent the general process for computing the number of border 
            squares.  In her group, Sharmeen, shares, "S and so <m>s+s+\left(s-2\right)+\left(s-2\right)</m>. 
            Though that's kind of complicated. Is there any other way to put it?".  Given Sharmeen's original 
            method from the day before (<m>4 \times 10-4</m>), what question might you ask Sharmeen to help her 
            link her current method to her previoous one?

          <p>
            As the discussion progresses, students share ways to represent the computation using more than one 
            variable.  Sharmeen abandons her original expression as a group member want to "make it simpler" and 
            instead uses, <m>s+s+m+m</m>.  Recall that on the first day of The Border Problem, Cathy made an 
            intentional effort to list all student approaches on the board with 
            <me>
              4 \times 10 -4
            </me>
            <me>
              10+9+9+8
            </me>
            <me>
              10+10+8+8
            </me>
            <me>
              \left(10 \times 10\right)-\left(8 \times 8\right)
            </me>
            <me>
              9 \times 4
            </me>
            <me>
              4 \times 8 +4
            </me>
            In your groups, discuss how these multiple representations might play a role in transitioning the 
            class to use only one variable.  What will eventually happen with the expresions if all of the 
            methods use the same variable to represent the "10" from their expressions of the <m>10 \times 10</m> 
            square computation?  How can Cathy leverage these expressions to help the students see they are the 
            same?  What does the "8" represent in Sharmeen's first symbolic expression?

    In order to make connections with what is taught in the secondary curriculum, we begin by examining some 
    activities from the Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP).  This activity will set the stage for reflecting 
    on both the mathematics and the teaching and learning practices involved in the exploration.  In particular, 
    we will consider the relevance of the depth of content knowledge on classroom decisions made by the teacher.

      <title>Case Study: Over and Over and Out</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Jill's <em>Algebra I</em> class has been working with radicals and as a result of using her calculator, 
          a student, Kay, raises a question during class.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jill</em> : How did the homework go last night?  Does anyone have any questions about reducing the 
          radical expressions?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Kay</em> : Well, I don't really have a question about reducing the radicals, but I did have another 
          question that's kind of related to what we're doing.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jill</em> : OK, go for it.  What'ya got?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Kay</em> : Well, as I was working on some of the radical simplifying stuff, I was checking them by 
          using my calculator to see if my answer matched when I punched the original expression on the 
          calculator.  Anyway, I got to playing with my calculator during my advising period and noticed that 
          when I entered something like <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and kept hitting the equals button, it ended up giving 
          me 1.  I tried it with <m>\sqrt{3}</m> and it did the same thing.  Will that always happen?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jill</em> : Interesting.  Maybe we should take some time to try this.  <em>(To the class)</em> 
          What I want you to do is get in your groups and see if you can find any numbers that when you take the 
          square root over and over again do not end up at 1.
        </p>

        <p>
          [<em>Jill allows the students to look for a counter example for about 10 minutes and then brings the 
            class back together for discussion.</em>]
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jill</em> : Well, what did you find?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jeff</em> : Our group couldn't find any number that didn't end up at 1.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Anna</em> : Neither could ours.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Sean</em> : At first our group thought we had found an example where it just kept getting bigger 
          and bigger, but that was because I was using the <m>x^2</m> button instead of the square root.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jill</em> : That raises an interesting question though, Sean.  Does the type of operation make a 
          difference in whether or not it converges to a certain number?  The word <em>converge</em> just means 
          that it gets closer and closer to that number as you keep repeating it.  Yes, Erin.  Do you want to 
          say something?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Erin</em> : Well, I have a graphing calculator and I was trying to find an easier way to enter 
          this stuff in it to do the repeat.  I used the [ANS] key.  What it does is take the last thing you got 
          out of your calculator and does a new thing to it.  So what I did was put the <em>square root of x</em> 
          in my <em>Y=</em> list and then entered <m>Y_1\left(3\right)</m> on my screen and got 1.73 something.  
          Then I just put in <m>Y_1\left(ANS\right)</m> and kept hitting [ENTER].  This gave me the numbers that 
          got closer and closer to 1.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jill</em> : That's a great idea.  It also now makes it easier to try other types of functions like 
          Sean's <m>x^2</m> example.  Let's go through what Erin was talking about together on our class set of 
          graphing calculators.  Take out your calculators and look up front.
        </p>

        <p>
          [<em>Jill takes about 5 minutes to go through the mechanics of how to evaluate an iterated function on 
            the graphing calculator and then sent the groups exploring different functions.  She allowed them 
            approximately 20 minutes to get started before the bell rang.  She assigned them the task of 
            exploring this for homework and told the class that they would continue with the discussion the next 
            day.</em>]

        <p>
          The Next Day
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jill</em> : Does anyone have anything to share from your exploring last night?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jan</em> : I thought I'd try some other types of roots and so I tried <m>\sqrt[3]{x}</m> and it 
          went to 1 too.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jill</em> : Did it go to 1 no matter what number you started with?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jan</em> : Yeah.  For everything I tried.  So I think that anything with roots will go to 1.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Sam</em> : I thought that too, but I tried something a little different.  I did the same thing Jan 
          did with <m>\sqrt[3]{x}</m>, but then I tried it by putting a 2 in front and used <m>2\sqrt[3]{x}</m>.  
          This time it didn't go to 1, but went to 2.828 something.  So, it looks like it can go to things other 
          than 1.  Can we make up a function that will go to any number we want?

          You may have at one time used a scientific or standard calculator and entered an evaluation for 
          <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and then continued to press the [√] or [=] key only to see the decimal 
          approximation eventually get closer and closer to 1.  This illustrates values of an infinite sequence

          plugging it into a given function.  In this investigation we will explore such sequences and look for 
          common properties.

          <em>Problem Statement</em>:  In the example given above, a specific function, 
          <m>f\left(x\right)=\sqrt{x}</m>, and a specific starting point, <m>x=2</m>, were used to generate the 
          sequence.  In this exploration, consider a more general question.  Suppose you have a function <m>f</m> 
          and the infinite sequence, 
          <m>f\left(x_0\right), f\left(f\left(x_0\right)\right), f\left(f\left(f\left(x_0\right)\right)\right), \ldots</m>.  
          In this exploration, we will examine this sequence for some specific families of functions and then generate 
          more questions for further investigation.

          Here we will use the <em>TI-Nspire CX II CAS</em>, but this can also be done with a variety of other 
          computer algebra systems.  To begin, we will explore a very familiar function, <m>f\left(x\right)=ax^2</m>, 
          for various values of the parameter, <m>a</m>.  Open a new document and select <em>1:New Document</em>.  
          When prompted, select <em>2:Add Graphs</em> to open a graphing screen.  Enter the function 
          <m>f_1\left(x\right)=x^2</m> in the command line at the bottom of the screen and press [enter] to 
          display the graph.  You will be able to morph this graph later by grabbing it in order to explore the 
          effect of the parameter, <m>a</m>, on the sequence.
