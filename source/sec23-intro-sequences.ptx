  <title>Introduction to Sequences</title>
<introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec12-ccss-content-overview"/>, we looked at the CCSS and noted that young learners tended 
      be adept at analyzing patterns.  Sequences are a type of pattern that can take on many representations and 
      can allow for various approaches by students for analyzing and solving them.  For this reason, this 
      section will examine how students see sequences from both a mathematical and pedagogical perspective.  
      While there are many different kinds of sequences, we will focus primarily on arithmetic, geometric, 
      figurative, and recursive sequences.  We will ground our discussion in some classroom excerpts where 
      students are grappling with patterns and also address how the students begin to represent these patterns 
      and the effect this has on their thinking.

    To begin, consider <em>The Border Problem: Part 1</em> found in <em>Connecting Mathematical Ideas: 
    Middle School Video Cases to Support Teaching and Learning (2005)</em> by Jo Boaler and Cathy Humphreys.  
    In this video case, students are exploring the pattern for finding the number of small shaded squares along 
    the outer edge of a larger <m>10 \times 10</m> square as seen in <xref ref="fig-border-10-10"/>.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          Watch the classroom episode of Cathy Humphreys' 7th grade class working on ways to find the border 
          of a square grid.  This video is found in the book, <em>Connecting Mathematical Ideas: Middle School 
          Video Cases to Support Teaching and Learning (2005)</em> by Jo Boaler and Cathy Humphreys.  You may 
          want to following along with the provided transcript (pp. 1-5) from Boaler and Humphreys (2005) in 
          case you have a hard time discerning what is being said.

            As you watch the episode for the first time, make some notes of at least 3 things the teacher did 
            to facilitate the discussion and some quick thoughts on why she chose this problem.

            Compare your observations from the video with those of your fellow group members.  Discuss in your 
            groups why you think the teacher did what she did.  How did the students respond?
