  <title>Introduction to Sequences</title>
<introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec12-ccss-overview"/>, we looked at the CCSS and noted that young learners tended 
      be adept at analyzing patterns.  Sequences are a type of pattern that can take on many representations and 
      can allow for various approaches by students for analyzing and solving them.  For this reason, this 
      section will examine how students see sequences from both a mathematical and pedagogical perspective.  
      While there are many different kinds of sequences, we will focus primarily on arithmetic, geometric, 
      figurative, and recursive sequences.  We will ground our discussion in some classroom excerpts where 
      students are grappling with patterns and also address how the students begin to represent these patterns 
      and the effect this has on their thinking.  To begin, we should define what we mean by a sequence.

            A <em>sequence</em> is a list of terms <m>a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots</m>, given in a specific order.  
            These sequenced values can also be thought of as a function of the term number, <m>n</m>, and 
            denoted as <m>a_n</m>.  For the practical use of a computer algebra system, we often express the 
            terms using function notation, <m>a\left(n\right)</m>, so that we can define it in the CAS and 
            operate on its terms.  To express the entire sequence we often use the notation, 
            <m>\left \{a_n \right \}</m>, since we can think of the entire sequence as a list such as 
            <m>\left \{a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\right \}</m>.

    To begin, consider <em>The Border Problem: Part 1</em> found in <em>Connecting Mathematical Ideas: 
    Middle School Video Cases to Support Teaching and Learning (2005)</em> by Jo Boaler and Cathy Humphreys.  
    In this video case, students are exploring the pattern for finding the number of small shaded squares along 
    the outer edge of a larger <m>10 \times 10</m> square as seen in <xref ref="fig-border-10-10"/>.

          of a square grid.  This video is found in the book, <em>Connecting Mathematical Ideas: Middle School

            The teacher, Cathy, in the episode allows for several different students to explain their way of 
            determining the total number of squares and she writes their method on the board with numerical 
            representations that align with the method.  For example, Sharmeen shares her thinking, "Well, first 
            I started out with forty from ten times four and then I subtracted four from that because there would 
            be four squares overlapping, and so that got thirty-six.".  Here Cathy writes on the board 
            <m>4 \times 10 -4</m>.  At this point, Cathy asks the questions, "And the four was for ...?", and 
            "OK. And this four was for?".  Discuss in your groups why you think Cathy chose this move in the 
            lesson?  From an algebraic standpoint, what is she trying to set up for later discussion?  How is 
            Cathy's move related to Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno's model for the development of symbolic meaning 
            (see <xref ref="fig-kaput-blanton-moreno"/> and <xref ref="fig-kaput-blanton-moreno-nested"/>)?

            Cathy then asks Colin to go up to the front and show his method.  Colin shares, "Anyway, so I, like, 
            I know this side is ten so I just did like ten and then this one, this one's the overlapping one, so 
            then this would be nine, then this one would be nine, too, because this one's overlapping. And then 
            for this, one it'd be eight because these two, this one is being used by this one and this one is 
            being used by that one."  As Colin explains, Cathy writes on the board, <m>10+9+9+8</m>.  In looking 
            at Sharmeen's and Colin's representations, how do you see them as the same?  How are they different?  
            Is there a way to move from one to the other in a way that makes <em>physical</em> sense?

            square into a <m>6 \times 6</m> square.  She then asks them to use whatever method they want from 
            those previously discussed to determine the number of border square in the <m>6 \times 6</m> square.  
            In your groups, discuss why you think Cathy asked this question and where you think she is going with 
            this task?

    Now that we have speculated about Cathy's plan for her class, let's see where she takes the discussion on the 
    next day.  In the next activity, pay attention to the way Cathy tries to draw connections between the 
    physical representations of border squares and the way the computations are taking place.

            At this stage of the discussion, Sarah responds by saying, "Well, the first two numbers are the same 
            numbers and the last two numbers are the same numbers.".  Cathy then has the students work in their 
            groups to try and find a way to represent the general process for computing the number of border 
            squares.  In her group, Sharmeen, shares, "S and so <m>s+s+\left(s-2\right)+\left(s-2\right)</m>. 
            Though that's kind of complicated. Is there any other way to put it?".  Given Sharmeen's original 
            method from the day before (<m>4 \times 10-4</m>), what question might you ask Sharmeen to help her 
            link her current method to her previoous one?

            As the discussion progresses, students share ways to represent the computation using more than one 
            variable.  Sharmeen abandons her original expression as a group member want to "make it simpler" and 
            instead uses, <m>s+s+m+m</m>.  Recall that on the first day of The Border Problem, Cathy made an 
            intentional effort to list all student approaches on the board with 
            <me>
              4 \times 10 -4

            </me>
            In your groups, discuss how these multiple representations might play a role in transitioning the 
            class to use only one variable.  What will eventually happen with the expresions if all of the 
            methods use the same variable to represent the "10" from their expressions of the <m>10 \times 10</m> 
            square computation?  How can Cathy leverage these expressions to help the students see they are the

            At the beginning of the group work, Sharmeen expressed a way to express the total using only one 
            variable (see part (b)), but then the group decided that it was "kind of complicated" and wanted to 
            find another way to express it more simply.  During the class discussion, Stephanie reiterates 
            Sharmeen's expression by suggesting, "Um, I think maybe you could, like, do <m>x</m> plus <m>x</m> 
            for the top and the bottom, or whatever letter you're using, and then you could do 
            <m>\left(x-2\right)+\left(x-2\right)</m>. And that would give you the, um, the total border.".  If 
            you were the teacher and had heard Sharmeen's group discussion while circulating in the class, what 
            would you have done when Stephanie made her suggestion?

            expression?  What does the "8" represent in Sharmeen's and Stephanie's expression?

    The classroom exchange provides a context to explore this type of sequence.  Understanding how a sequence 
    behaves can give us, as teachers, a way to allow students to explore their own observations while 
    facilitating a fruitful discussion.  Cathy does a masterful job in allowing students to express their ideas 
    and connecting them during the whole-class interaction.  So, let's look a little deeper at this type of 
    sequence by exploring the question Cathy posed when she asked the students to image shrinking the square 
    to a <m>6\times6</m> and using various methods to compute the total number of small squares on the border.  
    In this case, we will extend it more to consider the <m>n \times n</m> case.

    Some sequences like <em>arithmetic sequences</em> have properites like a <em>common difference</em> between 
    adjacent terms.  There are many types of phenomena that can be explained by this behavior; however, there 
    are other types of behavior that do no have a common difference (or constant rate of change).  In the next 
    activity, we will explore what can happen when the change between terms is not so easily described.  To 
    begin, consider the bouncing of a racquet ball as described in <xref ref="fig-ball-bounce-video"/>.

      <title>Ball Bounce and the Behavior of Its Sequence</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Consider the bouncing ball shown in the video in <xref ref="fig-ball-bounce-video"/>.  We are going to 
          explore the behavior of the successive heights the ball reaches as it continues to bounce.  You will 
          notice that as it bounces the next height in the sequence is smaller than the previous height.  Here 
          we will see if we can describe this height change and use a sequence to predict the height of the ball 
          on its <m>n^{th}</m> bounce if we know the original height from which the ball was dropped.
        </p>

        <p>
          To begin investigating infinite sequence, we start by grounding the mathematical concept within a 
          real-world context.  Let's consider the physical phenomenon arising from the bouncing ball we see in 
          the video in <xref ref="fig-ball-bounce-video"/>.  Suppose we drop a ball from a certain height and 
          measure its position over time.  One question we might want to explore deals with predicting the 
          height of the ball during the bouncing process.  In short, on the <m>5^{th}</m>, <m>6^{th}</m>, or 
          <m>7^{th}</m> bounce how high can we expect it to rise?  What about the <m>n^{th}</m> bounce? To 
          begin, we must know something about the rebound height of the ball as it relates to the previous 
          height before the drop.  We will use a device called a Calculator-Based Ranger (CBR2™) to collect 
          data related to this issue.  This device will measure the distance of the ball from the sensor as a 
          function of time.  We want to find the height, so we will need to subtract the distance of the ball 
          from the sensor from the height of the sensor.  You may choose to collect your own data or use the 
          data from the provided file, <em>BallBounce.tns</em>.  As seen in the video, the data generated once 
          the height is computed will look something like that data in <xref ref="fig-ball-bounce-graph"/>.

            First we need to generate data for the height of the ball.  Using the <em>BallBounce.tns</em> file, 
            add a <em>Lists &amp; Spreadsheet</em> page.  Click the top of the first column next to the "A", 
            and press the [var] key and select <em>3 Link To:</em> and choose <em>run1.time</em>.  Repeat this 
            process at the top of the second column selecting <em>run1.position</em> as shown below.
          </p>
          <p>
            To create a column with the actual height of the ball, we need to subtract the position data from 
            the original height of the sensor from the floor.  In the video, that height was measured to be 
            1.793 meters.  If you are collecting your own data, use your measurement of the original height of 
            the sensor.  To do this, go to the top of the third column in your spreadsheet and click on top 
            cell and type "height".  Directly below that cell click on the cell and <m>\mathbf{height:=}</m> 
            will appear.  Now enter <em>1.793-</em> and [var] and select run1.position as shown below.  This 
            will populate the column with the difference between the original sensor height and the position of 
            the ball yielding the actual height of the ball.

    The relationship from term to term you have just explored is called <em>geometric</em>.  Just like with 
    <em>arithmetic</em> sequences where we can determine its arithmetic nature by subtracting adjacent terms 
    to see if we always get the same result, with geometric sequences we can do the same, but using division 
    instead of subtraction.  In a sense, the structure of the behavior is the same, but instead of observing 
    the relationship between addition and subtraction, we notice the analogous relationship between 
    multiplication and division.

  <p>
    <definition xml:id="def-geometric-sequence">
      <title>Geometric Sequence</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <em>geometric sequence</em> is a sequence of non-zero numbers where each term after the first term 
          is found by multipying the previous term by a fixed number called the <em>common ratio</em>, <m>r</m>.  
          In otherwords, the sequence will be of the form, <m>a_n=ra_{n-1}</m>.  If we were to list the terms, we 
          would get <m>a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, \ldots</m>.  Therefore, the general <m>n^{th}</m> term can be 
          expressed as <m>a_n=ar^{n-1}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
  </p>

  <p>
    You will notice in the previous definition, if we take successive ratios as you did in the 
    <em>Ball Bounce</em> activity, we get <m>\frac{ar}{a}=\frac{ar^2}{ar}=\frac{ar^3}{ar^2}=\ldots =r</m>.  We 
    use the notation, <m>r</m>, here since we are referring to the common <em>ratio</em>.

    In order to make connections with what is taught in the secondary curriculum, we begin by examining some 
    activities from the Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP).  This activity will set the stage for reflecting 
    on both the mathematics and the teaching and learning practices involved in the exploration.  In particular, 
    we will consider the relevance of the depth of content knowledge on classroom decisions made by the teacher.

    Now that you have started to reflect on the mathematics and pedagogy present in the exploration, consider 
    the following classroom exchange as a teacher (Jill) interacts with her students.  Following the vignette, 
    you will be asked to respond to questions surrounding the discussion.
  </p>

  <p>
    <activity xml:id="act-over-and-over-and-out">
      <title>Case Study: Over and Over and Out</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Jill's <em>Algebra I</em> class has been working with radicals and as a result of using her calculator, 
          a student, Kay, raises a question during class.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jill</em> : How did the homework go last night?  Does anyone have any questions about reducing the 
          radical expressions?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Kay</em> : Well, I don't really have a question about reducing the radicals, but I did have another 
          question that's kind of related to what we're doing.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jill</em> : OK, go for it.  What'ya got?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Kay</em> : Well, as I was working on some of the radical simplifying stuff, I was checking them by 
          using my calculator to see if my answer matched when I punched the original expression on the 
          calculator.  Anyway, I got to playing with my calculator during my advising period and noticed that 
          when I entered something like <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and kept hitting the equals button, it ended up giving 
          me 1.  I tried it with <m>\sqrt{3}</m> and it did the same thing.  Will that always happen?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jill</em> : Interesting.  Maybe we should take some time to try this.  <em>(To the class)</em> 
          What I want you to do is get in your groups and see if you can find any numbers that when you take the 
          square root over and over again do not end up at 1.
        </p>

        <p>
          [<em>Jill allows the students to look for a counter example for about 10 minutes and then brings the 
            class back together for discussion.</em>]
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jill</em> : Well, what did you find?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jeff</em> : Our group couldn't find any number that didn't end up at 1.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Anna</em> : Neither could ours.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Sean</em> : At first our group thought we had found an example where it just kept getting bigger 
          and bigger, but that was because I was using the <c>x^2</c> button instead of the square root.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jill</em> : That raises an interesting question though, Sean.  Does the type of operation make a 
          difference in whether or not it converges to a certain number?  The word <em>converge</em> just means 
          that it gets closer and closer to that number as you keep repeating it.  Yes, Erin.  Do you want to 
          say something?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Erin</em> : Well, I have a graphing calculator and I was trying to find an easier way to enter 
          this stuff in it to do the repeat.  I used the <c>ANS</c> key.  What it does is take the last thing you got 
          out of your calculator and does a new thing to it.  So what I did was put the <em>square root of x</em> 
          in my <em>Y=</em> list and then entered <m>Y_1\left(3\right)</m> on my screen and got 1.73 something.  
          Then I just put in <m>Y_1\left(ANS\right)</m> and kept hitting <c>ENTER</c>.  This gave me the numbers that 
          got closer and closer to 1.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jill</em> : That's a great idea.  It also now makes it easier to try other types of functions like 
          Sean's <m>x^2</m> example.  Let's go through what Erin was talking about together on our class set of 
          graphing calculators.  Take out your calculators and look up front.
        </p>

        <p>
          [<em>Jill takes about 5 minutes to go through the mechanics of how to evaluate an iterated function on 
            the graphing calculator and then sent the groups exploring different functions.  She allowed them 
            approximately 20 minutes to get started before the bell rang.  She assigned them the task of 
            exploring this for homework and told the class that they would continue with the discussion the next 
            day.</em>]
        </p>

        <p>
          The Next Day
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jill</em> : Does anyone have anything to share from your exploring last night?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jan</em> : I thought I'd try some other types of roots and so I tried <m>\sqrt[3]{x}</m> and it 
          went to 1 too.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jill</em> : Did it go to 1 no matter what number you started with?
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Jan</em> : Yeah.  For everything I tried.  So I think that anything with roots will go to 1.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Sam</em> : I thought that too, but I tried something a little different.  I did the same thing Jan 
          did with <m>\sqrt[3]{x}</m>, but then I tried it by putting a 2 in front and used <m>2\sqrt[3]{x}</m>.  
          This time it didn't go to 1, but went to 2.828 something.  So, it looks like it can go to things other 
          than 1.  Can we make up a function that will go to any number we want?

      <title>Evaluate Me Again, Sam</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          You may have at one time used a scientific or standard calculator and entered an evaluation for 
          <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and then continued to press the <c>√</c> or <c>=</c> key only to see the decimal 
          approximation eventually get closer and closer to 1.  This illustrates values of an infinite sequence 
          where each element of the sequence is obtained by taking the previous element in the sequence and 
          plugging it into a given function.  In this investigation we will explore such sequences and look for 
          common properties.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Problem Statement</em>:  In the example given above, a specific function, 
          <m>f\left(x\right)=\sqrt{x}</m>, and a specific starting point, <m>x=2</m>, were used to generate the 
          sequence.  In this exploration, consider a more general question.  Suppose you have a function <m>f</m> 
          and the infinite sequence, 
          <m>f\left(x_0\right), f\left(f\left(x_0\right)\right), f\left(f\left(f\left(x_0\right)\right)\right), \ldots</m>.  
          In this exploration, we will examine this sequence for some specific families of functions and then generate 
          more questions for further investigation.

          Here we will use the <em>TI-Nspire CX II CAS</em>, but this can also be done with a variety of other 
          computer algebra systems.  To begin, we will explore a very familiar function, <m>f\left(x\right)=ax^2</m>, 
          for various values of the parameter, <m>a</m>.  Open a new document and select <em>1:New Document</em>.  
          When prompted, select <em>2:Add Graphs</em> to open a graphing screen.  Enter the function 
          <m>f_1\left(x\right)=x^2</m> in the command line at the bottom of the screen and press [enter] to 
          display the graph.  You will be able to morph this graph later by grabbing it in order to explore the 
          effect of the parameter, <m>a</m>, on the sequence.

        <p>
          In order to observe the behavior of this sequence graphically, generate a sequence plot by plotting the 
          term number vs. the iterate values.  To do this, insert a new page by pressing <c>ctrl</c> <c>+page</c> 
          and then selecting <em>2:Add Graphs</em>.  In this case, you do not want to graph a function, but the 
          sequence points.  To change the type of graph, press <c>menu</c> and then select 
          <em>3:Graph Entry/Edit</em> followed by <em>7:Sequence</em> and <em>1:Sequence</em>.  You will notice 
          that the command line at the top of the screen will change yielding fields into which you can enter 
          the sequence relationship and initial value (see images below).  Since we want to generate an iterative 
          sequence based on the function stored in <m>f1\left(x\right)</m>, we enter 
          <m>u1\left(n\right)=f1\left(u1\left(n-1\right)\right)</m> so that the sequence plotter will use the 
          function value of the pervious number in the sequence to generate the new number in the sequence.  Use 
          0.5 as your initial value for now.  You can adjust the viewing window by grabbing a tick mark on the 
          axis by holding down the "click/grab" key located in the center of the NavPad (mouse pad) until the 
          hand closes.  Dragging your finger across the NavPad will adjust the view.  If you want to adjust only 
          one axis scale at a time, simply hold down the shift key while you move on the screen.  To adjust 
          where the axes are located within the window, move to any open space in the graphing window and hold 
          the "click/grab" key down until the hand closes, then move the entire graph to any location you desire 
          (see images below).

          In order to explore the relationship between the parameter, <m>a</m>, and the behavior of the 
          sequence, it will be helpful to view the function and the sequence plot side-by-side.  In order to do 
          this press <c>+page</c> to insert a new page and then press <c>esc</c> since you do not wish to insert 
          just one application, but two in a side-by-side layout.  Now press <c>doc</c> and select 
          <em>5:Page Layout</em> and <em>2:Select Layout</em> followed by <em>2:Layout 2</em>.  This will give a 
          side-by-side partitioned screen that will allow you to place a different application in each partition.

          In order to copy the graph page for both the function and the scatter plot, you must first select 
          them.  Page back to the function graph by pressing <c>ctrl</c> followed by the left arrow until you 
          get to the page you want.  Unfortunately you cannot just copy the page, but must “select” it first.  
          To do this, press <c>doc</c> and then select <em>5:Page Layout</em> followed by <em>3:Select App</em>.  
          In the future, the shortcut for selecting an application is <c>ctrl</c> <c>K</c>.  You will see the 
          border of the screen begin to flash indicating it is selected.  Then press <c>ctrl</c> <c>C</c> to 
          copy it (just like on a computer).  Now page back to the split screen by pressing <c>ctrl</c> followed 
          by the right arrow until you reach it.  To paste the graphing screen into the left side, just press 
          <c>ctrl</c> <c>V</c> (like paste on a computer).  To get the sequence plot pasted into the right side 
          of the screen, repeat this process, but you will need to click on the right side of the screen to make 
          it active before pasting.  You will know that a portion of the screen is active since it will have a 
          darkened border around it (see screens below).

          At this point you are ready to examine the effects of the parameter, <m>a</m>, on the behavior of the 
          sequence.  The side-by-side view of the two graphs allows you to manipulate the function and see the 
          sequence plot change dynamically in real time.  To do this, move the cursor to the edge of the parabola 
          until you see the dilation icon appear as shown below.  Press and hold the click key until the "hand" 
          closes to grab the parabola then use the arrow keys to “morph” it.  To "let go" just press <c>esc</c>.

            As you have seen, the parameter, <m>a</m>, affects the behavior of the sequence.  Are there other

            possibility that the “seed”, or initial, value might also affect it.  At this point change the seed 
            value and investigate how the parameter, <m>a</m>, and the seed value interact.  You can change the 
            seed by clicking in the sequence window and editing the initial term or by grabbing the initial 
            point (green) in the sequence plot and moving it or editing it directly in the command line.  To 
            make the command line visible, press <c>ctrl</c> <c>G</c> or double click in any white space in the

          <p>
            Since we will want to explore the effects of the seed value for multiple trials, it will make it 
            easier to place an editable seed value on the graphing page.  To do this, on the graphing page 
            containing the parabola, select <c>menu</c> and then <em>1:Actions</em> followed by 
            <em>B:Insert Slider</em>.  Type the variable name, <m>\mathbf{seed}</m>, into the slider 
            <em>Variable</em> dialogue box and press <c>enter</c>.  You can place the slider anywhere in the 
            window and elongate it by grabbing the dot on either end.  To adjust the slider after it is set in 
            place, click on the slider box and press <c>ctrl</c> <c>menu</c> to open the attributes and select 
            <em>1:Move</em> to move location or <em>2:Settings</em> and edit the settings as you wish. You can 
            also change the slider settings to allow finer step sizes when dragging (below shows changing it to 
            0.01).

            Now to connect the slider to the sequence plot, edit the sequence plot setting as you did before so

            seed value on the graphing page for the function.  You can also move the slider to a convenient

            Although we may have a conjecture at this point, we still need to prove that this conjecture will

    The previous explorations have given us some insight into predicting when an iterative sequence will converge 
    and when it might diverge.  So how can we be certain of the behavior and then, as teachers, help our 
    students discover the properties behind the behavior?  Here we will take a deeper look into the observations 
    made in our previous investigations and see how iterative sequences can play a role in practical 
    applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    The concept of iteration is an important part of the mathematical landscape.  It is used in real-world 
    applications to find solutions that have no direct algebraic solution as well as for approximating values 
    of mathematical constants such as <m>e</m> and <m>\pi</m>.  Having taken Calculus, you are already familiar 
    with one such iteration process, Newton's Method.  Recall that Newton's Method allows the approximation of 
    roots by using the projection along a tangent line to the x-axis as a new approximation of the root.  Then 
    the new value from the x-axis is used as the new point of tangency and the process continues until the 
    desired level of accuracy for the root is achieved.
  </p>

  <p>
    <m>\mathbf{Newton's}</m> <m>\mathbf{Method:}</m> <m>\mathbf{A}</m> <m>\mathbf{Refresher}</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    We know that some equations of the form <m>f\left(x\right)=0</m> can be solved exactly (e.g. using the 
    quadratic formula).  However, the general equations that can be solved exactly are very few within the realm 
    of mathematical endeavor.  To be able to approximate a solution, Isaac Newton noticed that as a point on a 
    curve approaches the root of the function, its tangent line at that point begins to have an x-intercept that 
    is approximately the root desired (see <xref ref="fig-newton-method-tangents"/>).
  </p>

  <p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-newton-method-tangents">
        <caption>Tangents Lines and Newton's Method</caption>
        <image source="images/newton-method-tangents.png" width="60%"/>
      </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    Newton's idea was to “surf” the tangent line.  In other words, pick an x-coordinate of a point you know is 
    close to the actual root, and then find where the tangent line to the curve at that point intersects the 
    x-axis.  Now use the x-intercept of the tangent line as the new x-coordinate as stated earlier and repeat 
    the process.  With each iteration, the approximation gets closer to the root of the function.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, suppose you wish to find the solution for <m>f\left(x\right)=0</m>, where 
    <m>f\left(x\right)=x^2-3</m>.  As you can see, one solution is approximately 2 as can be seen from the graph 
    in <xref ref="fig-newton-method-example-function"/>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-newton-method-example-function">
        <caption>Graph of <m>f\left(x\right)=x^2-3</m></caption>
        <image source="images/newton-method-example-function.png" width="60%"/>
      </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to find a better approximation, we can notice that if <m>x_0</m> is our initial guess, then the 
    next choice for an approximation of the root will be 
    <m>x_1=x_0-\frac{f\left(x\right)}{f'\left(x\right)}</m>, since this is where the tangent line at <m>x=x_0</m> 
    intersects the x-axis.  Repeating this process will give better approximations.
  </p>

  <p>
    In practice, we can approximate using Newton's Method on our CAS by entering the original function in one 
    location and the formula for the next approximation in another function location referring to the original 
    function.  In the figure below, the original function is entered in the function <m>f\left(x\right)</m> and 
    the iteration formula is in <m>nm\left(x\right)</m> for “Newton's Method” 
    (see <xref ref="fig-newton-method-numerical"/>).
  </p>

  <p>
    We now simply evaluate the <m>nm\left(x\right)</m> function at our initial guess and then successively using 
    our result as the new input into <m>nm\left(x\right)</m>.  You can see that with just a few iterations, we 
    get a solution to 11-decimal place accuracy.  Here we have actually approximated <m>\sqrt{3}</m> since the 
    function we are using is <m>f\left(x\right)=x^2-3</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-newton-method-numerical">
        <caption>Numerical Iterations of Newton's Method</caption>
        <image source="images/newton-method-numerical.png" width="60%"/>
    </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    From a graphical standpoint, suppose we begin with an initial value of 3.  The x-intercept of the tangent 
    line at <m>x=3</m> is 2 and thus a new tangent is constructed at <m>x=2</m>.  As can be seen from the sketch 
    in <xref ref="fig-newton-method-tangents-sqrt3"/>, the new x-intercept is much closer to the root.  It does 
    not take many iterations of this process to get extremely accurate approximations.

    As we have seen from exploration and classroom vignettes, not all self-iterating functions yield a 
    convergence.  So how can we tell if a particular function will converge to a value at all or whether or not 
    it may have multiple values that are possible for convergence?  How do we predict the value to which they 
    will converge?  Are there any criteria that can be applied to predict convergence?
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us begin by examining the familiar function from the activity, <em>Evaluate Me Again Sam</em>, 
    <xref ref="act-evaluate-me-again-sam"/>, with <m>f\left(x\right)=\sqrt{x}</m>.  Below is a graph of <m>f</m> 
    along with the graph of <m>y=x</m>.  The reason for <m>y=x</m> will become evident shortly.  Assume that 
    <m>f</m> is continuous and differentiable on the desired interval.  Also let us define the iteration by 
    stating <m>x_{n+1}=f\left(x_n\right)</m>.  All this says is that we choose the previous output of <m>f</m> 
    as the new input of <m>f</m> each time we iterate the function with itself.  Here is the reason for graphing 
    <m>y=x</m> along with <m>f</m>.  Since the outputs are found along the <em>y</em>-axis, we get 
    <m>x_{n+1}=y_n</m>.  This process is shown by the arrows marking the progress of the iteration on the graph in 
    <xref ref="fig-iteration-cobweb-sqrtx"/>.  We begin with <m>x_0</m> and find its corresponding output 
    (<m>y_0</m>) on the function.  We then move horizontally until we meet the line <m>y=x</m> since this is 
    where <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are the same.  We now move vertically to the <em>x</em>-axis so that we stop 
    on the “new input” (<m>x_1=y_0</m>).  We repeat the process by moving vertically to the function's new 
    output.  As you can see by following the arrows in the graph, we keep moving closer and closer to the point 
    of intersection between the graph of <m>f</m> and <m>y=x</m>.  But why is the intersection with <m>y=x</m> 
    important?

  </p>

  <p>
    The point where a function intersects the line <m>y=x</m> is important and is called a <em>fixed point</em>.  
    The reason it plays a vital role in the convergence of iterated functions is that it has the property of 
    the function's output being equal to the function's input.
  </p>

  <p>
    <definition xml:id="def-fixed-point">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <em>fixed point</em> of a function, <m>f</m>, is a number, <m>p</m>, in the domain of <m>f</m> such 
          that <m>f\left(p\right)=p</m>.  In other words, when applying <m>f</m>, the point, <m>p</m>, stays 
          fixed.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
  </p>

  <p>
    Since the convergence of an iterated function relies on the fact that the 
    <m>\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}f\left(x_n\right)=p</m> when <m>\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x_{n+1}=p</m> and 
    thus <m>f\left(p\right)=p</m> assuming <m>f</m> continuous, the intersection of <m>f</m> and <m>y=x</m> 
    gives us possible values of convergence for our iterated function.  We can gain insight into some general 
    principles for convergence by looking at the earlier investigation found in the IMP materials, 
    <em>Over, and Over, and Over, and…</em>.  Recall that in this exploration, the students began with linear 
    functions.  For functions such as <m>f\left(x\right)=3x+2</m>, the iterated function diverged no matter 
    what initial seed value was chosen.  Consider the function <m>g\left(x\right)=\frac{1}{2}x+1</m> and 
    examine the progression of the inputs as shown in <xref ref="fig-iteration-cobweb-halfxplus1"/> using arrows 
    along the graph.  Notice that no matter which side of the fixed point you begin with, the result converges 
    on the fixed point.
  </p>

    </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    Now consider the function, <m>h\left(x\right)=2x-1</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
   <sidebyside width="45%"> 
   <figure xml:id="fig-iteration-cobweb-2xminus1-1">

  </p>

  <p>
    As can be seen here, no matter which side of the fixed point we choose, the iteration diverges to either 
    <m>\pm \infty</m>.  In this case, the fact that <m>h</m> is steeper than <m>y=x</m> means as we 
    choose points near the fixed point to use for iteration, the mapping onto the line <m>y=x</m> prior to the 
    re-evaluation of <m>h</m> moves away from the fixed point.  As we saw with the function 
    <m>g\left(x\right)=\frac{1}{2}x+1</m> earlier, the mapping back to the line <m>y=x</m> prior to 
    re-evaluation of <m>g</m> causes the <m>x_n</m> to approach the fixed point.  The behavior near these types 
    of fixed points has given rise to the categorizations of <em>repelling</em> and <em>attracting</em> fixed 
    points.
  </p>

  <p>
    So if sometimes we are repelled from a fixed point and sometimes we are attracted to one, how can we tell 
    what will happen?  For example, when using <m>f\left(x\right)=\sqrt{x}</m>, we saw any seed we used be 
    attracted to 1, but with <m>f\left(x\right)=x^2</m>, it was repelled.  Why?
  </p>

  <p>
    To look deeper into this let's reconsider our earlier activity from IMP, 
    <em>Over, and Over, and Over, and...</em>, we discussed in <xref ref="act-over-and-over"/>.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          In looking at the IMP activity, <em>Over, and Over, and Over, and...</em>, we noticed that in some 
          cases iteration converged, but in other cases we had divergence.  Instead of looking at specific linear 
          functions, here we will take a look at the general case for <m>f\left(x\right)=mx+b</m>.

            On your CAS, define the function, <m>f\left(x\right)=m \cdot x+b</m>.  Note that on most CAS, you 
            need to make sure to use the multiplication operator between the <m>m</m> and the <m>x</m> since 
            we could easily name a variable with a multi-letter name.  Now use your CAS to evalute and obtain 
            expressions for <m>f\left(x\right)</m>, <m>f\left(f\left(x\right)\right)</m>, 
            <m>f\left(f\left(f\left(x\right)\right)\right)</m>, and 
            <m>f\left(f\left(f\left(f\left(x\right)\right)\right)\right)</m>.  Describe any patterns you see in 
            the expressions.

            Based on your observations, we want to prove that your conjecture for <m>f^n\left(x\right)</m> is 
            always true.  Proof by induction is a means to do this.  Essentially, you assume it is true for the 
            <m>k^{th}</m> iteration and then try to show it is true for the <m>\left(k+1\right)^{st}</m> case.  
            Based on your expression from part (b), assume the form of <m>f^k\left(x\right)</m> and plug 
            <m>x=mx+b</m> in for <m>x</m> in your expression and rearrange the terms.  Do you get the same 
            thing as if you replaced all of the <m>k</m> in your <m>f^k\left(x\right)</m> expression with 
            <m>k+1</m>?  If so, you have shown that you can always get to the next largest <m>n</m> value and 
            so this will continue to infinity.

            Now that we have established that your expression for <m>f^n\left(x\right)</m> will always work, 
            we need to find when this will converge and when it will diverge.  Consider the long sum that is 
            associated with <m>b</m> in your expression (a sum of powers of <m>m</m>).  Based on what you know 
            from geometric series (think back to Calculus 2), for what values of <m>m</m> will this series

            If the sum in the term associated with <m>b</m> in your expression converges for your conditions on

            will also converge?  Explain.

    As you have observed in your investigation in <xref ref="act-over-and-over-analyzed"/>, for a linear 
    function, the iteration's convergence depends on the value of the slope, <m>m</m>.  This leads to the 
    following theorem where the proof consists of your observations from the activity.
  </p>

  <p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-linear-iteration">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f\left(x\right)=mx+b</m> be a linear function and let 
          <m>f^n\left(x\right)=\left(\underbrace{f\circ \cdots \circ f}_{\text{n times}}\right)\left(x\right)</m>.  
          The sequence, <m>\left\{f^n\right\}</m>, converges if <m>\left|m\right|\lt 1</m> and diverges if 
          <m>\left|m\right|\geq 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Consider the iterations for <m>f^2\left(x\right)=m^2x+b\left(m+1\right)</m> and 
          <m>f^3\left(x\right)=m^3x+b\left(m^2+m+1\right)</m>.  In general, we could conclude that 
          <m>f^n\left(x\right)=m^nx+b\left(m^{n-1}+\cdots m^2+m+1\right)</m>.  We can use proof by induction to 
          show this holds.  Assume <m>f^k\left(x\right)=m^kx+b\left(m^{k-1}+\cdots m^2+m+1\right)</m>.  We get 
          <m>f^{k+1}\left(x\right)=m^k\left(mx+b\right)+b\left(m^{k-1}+\cdots m^2+m+1\right)</m>.  Expanding and 
          collecting like terms gives 
          <m>f^{k+1}\left(x\right)=m^{k+1}x+m^kb+b\left(m^{k-1}+\cdots m^2+m+1\right)</m>, and therefore 
          <m>f^{k+1}\left(x\right)=m^{k+1}x+b\left(m^k+m^{k-1}+\cdots m^2+m+1\right)</m>.  By induction, this 
          holds.  In order to converge, the geometric series <m>m^n+m^{n-1}+\cdots m^2+m+1</m> needs 
          <m>\left|m\right|\lt 1</m>.  If <m>\left|m\right|\lt 1</m>, then <m>m^n \rightarrow 0</m> as 
          <m>n \rightarrow \infty</m> and thus <m>\left\{f^n\right\}</m> converges.  If 
          <m>\left|m\right|\geq 1</m> then the series diverges and the <m>m^nx</m> term will either diverge or 
          simply be <m>x</m> in the case of <m>m=1</m>.  In either case, <m>\left\{f^n\right\}</m> will diverge.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    
  </p>

  <p>
    The use of linear functions to analyze the convergence or divergence of the iterated function is helpful 
    since as with any continuous and differentiable function, we consider them locally linear as we zoom in on 
    a fixed point.  If we have a curved function with a fixed point and we start to get close to the fixed point, 
    it will start to behave like the line in <xref ref="thm-linear-iteration"/>.  Therefore, this leads us to 
    the following argument regarding convergence of iterated functions with fixed points.
  </p>

  <p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-fixed-point-convergence">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be a continuous and differentiable function with a fixed point, <m>z=f\left(z\right)</m>.  
          Further, let <m>x_n=f\left(x_{n-1}\right)</m>.  If <m>x_0</m> lies on an interval, <m>I</m>, 
          containing <m>z</m> such that <m>\left| f'\left(x\right) \right| \lt 1</m> for all <m>x \in I</m>, 
          then <m>x_n</m> converges to <m>z</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>x_0 \in I</m> such that <m>\left| f'\left(x\right) \right| \lt 1</m> for all 
          <m>x \in I</m>.  Since <m>x_1=f\left(x_0\right)</m> and 
          <m>f\left(z\right)=z \Rightarrow</m> <m>x_1-z=f\left(x_0\right)-f\left(z\right)</m>.  Now by the 
          Mean Value Theorem, there exists some <m>c</m> between <m>x_0</m> and <m>z</m> such that 
          <m>f'\left(c\right)=\frac{f\left(x_0\right)-f\left(z\right)}{x_0-z}</m> and thus 
          <m>f\left(x_0\right)-f\left(z\right)=\left(x_0-z\right) \cdot f'\left(c\right)</m>.  Since 
          <m>c \in I</m> and by assumption <m>\left| f'\left(x\right) \right| \lt 1</m> for all <m>x \in I</m> 
          <m>\Rightarrow</m> <m>\left|x_1-z\right| \leq k\left|x_0-z\right|</m> for some <m>k</m> with 
          <m>\left|k\right| \lt 1</m>.   Therefore, <m>x_1 \in I</m>.  Using a similar argument, 
          <m>\left|x_2-z\right| \leq k\left|x_1-z\right|\leq k^2\left|x_0-z\right|</m>.  In general, we can 
          state that <m>\left|x_n-z\right|\leq k^n\left|x_0-z\right|</m>.  Since 
          <m>\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow \infty}k^n=0</m>, we get 
          <m>\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow \infty} \left|x_n-z\right|=0</m> and thus 
          <m>\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow \infty}x_n=z=f\left(z\right)</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
  </p>

  <p>
    So what does this theorem say about convergence to fixed points?  Basically, the theorem says that if the 
    fixed point, <m>z</m>, is in an interval where <m>\left|f'\left(x\right)\right| \gt 1</m>, then the mapping 
    that transforms the outputs to inputs back into the function is expanding and thus the iteration process 
    diverges.

  </p>

  <p>
    Although Newton's Method is very efficient for finding zeros of a function, a more simplistic method 
    involves only the iteration of a function with itself using only a small alteration.  Suppose you are 
    looking for the root of a polynomial, <m>p\left(x\right)</m>.  The process boils down to solving the 
    equation, <m>p\left(x\right)=0</m>.  Now consider the transformed equation formed by adding <m>x</m> to 
    both sides of the original equation, <m>p\left(x\right)+x=x</m>.  If we let 
    <m>q\left(x\right)=p\left(x\right)+x</m>, we are essentially finding a solution to <m>q\left(x\right)=x</m>.  
    We know from our earlier discussion that this solution is simply a fixed point for <m>q\left(x\right)</m>.  
    Based on the fact that repeated iteration will converge to a fixed point (if convergence does occur), we 
    can simply take the original function, add <m>x</m>, and then iterate it with itself as a method to find 
    its root.  The down side of this process is that not all fixed points are accessible through iteration as 
    we have seen in earlier examples.  However, this does remain a very simple algorithm for finding roots 
    although not as efficient as Newton's Method.

  <title>Figurative Sequences</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The last type of sequence we will explore is a <em>figurative sequence</em>.  Consider the following 
      classroom exchange between a teacher, Sarah, and her algebra class.  In this class, Sarah is having her 
      students explore patterns based on the construction of staircases using blocks.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Sarah has been working with her students on sequences and has posed the following task where they need 
        to build staircases using blocks of the form found in <xref ref="fig-block-staircase"/>.
      </p>

      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sarah</em> : I gave each group some blocks and I want you to build at least the first four sets 
        of staircases as I have drawn on the board.  Notice that the staircases I have drawn have heights of 
        one, two, and three.  Our main goal is to be able to determine how many blocks we would need to build 
        a staircase with a height of 50.  We could simply start building it, but we would not be sure how many 
        blocks we would need before we began.  So, collect some data and see if you can find a pattern that 
        would allow us to compute it.
      </p>

      <p>
        [<em>Sarah allows the students to spend about 20 minutes building some models and recording some data.</em>]
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sarah</em> : OK, let's see what you've come up with.  [<em>Sarah draws a group number out of her 
        bucket to determine which gorup will report out</em>].  Group 4.  What did you find?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Cait</em> : Well, we just noticed that when we built them, we could just take the staircase that 
        we built before and put a row on the bottom that was just one block more than the bottom of the 
        staircase.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sarah</em> : Nice observation.  Did any other groups notice any other patterns?  Yeah, Ben?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ben</em> : We just built a bunch and wrote the total blocks in a table.  At first we thought it 
        might be an arithmetic sequence and it kind of was, but not.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sarah</em> : What do you mean, "...it kind of was, but not."?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Ben</em> : Well, when we subtracted we didn't get a common difference, but did get a pattern.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Sarah</em> : Can you describe your pattern?
      </p>

        <em>Ben</em> : Instead of the numbers always being the same, they just kept getting bigger.  You know...
        one at a time.  Like at first the difference was 2, then 3, then 4, and so on.  So it was kind of 
        arithmetic, but it was the differences that was arithmetic because those all had a change of 1.  You 
        know, from 2 to 3 is 1, then from 3 to 4 is 1, and from 4 to 5 is also 1.

  <title>Understanding Sequences and the Role of Representations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we seek to develop students' conceptual understanding of various topics, we need to consider the role 
      representations play in such development.  Here we will examine some of the literature regarding various 
      representational uses as it relates specifically to the teaching and learning of sequences and series.  
      Although from a formal perspective, algebraic representations might be considered the most powerful as we 
      can use them to present analytic proof, we often overlook the power inherent in other representations, 
      particularly with respect to concept development.  Once we have developed a concept, reasoning from the 
      algebraic representation might seem second nature to us.  However, once we have been temporally removed 
      from the development of the concept in our own experience, we often lose perspective on how the newcomer 
      to the concept constructs understanding.  This point of view is supported by Weigand's (1991) findings 
      where the teachers in the study only compared the different representations to existing concepts in their 
      view—a much different approach than the students in the study who used the various representations to 
      develop the concept.  In the words of Janvier (1987), “As soon as formulae are provided, the meaning 
      appears to vanish.  We can easily imagine that such is the case with conceptions fading out because of 
      'powerful' concepts.  That is why we advocate that conceptions should be developed at the 
      <em>preconcept</em> stage, in other words prior to the learning of the formalized concept” (p. 157).
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <p>
    Since we are using the <em>Over and Over and Over and…</em> activity from the Interactive Mathematics 
    Program (IMP) it is fitting to examine the previously mentioned study by Weigand (1991) where he examined 
    11th graders' learning of the same iterated sequence  
    <m>a_1,f\left(a_1 \right),f\left(f\left(a_1 \right)\right), \ldots</m> found in the IMP text.  In Weigand's 
    study, 79 students and 22 secondary mathematics teachers were engaged in exploring sequences generated by 
    iterating functions.  One of the goals was to investigate the influence representations have on students' 
    abilities to discover properties and solve problems.  Weigand chose iterated sequences as a context for the 
    study because it is often difficult to express sequences in explicit algebraic terms.  Therefore, the use 
    of a variety of representations becomes necessary in order for students to explore the behavior of these 
    sequences.  Weigand examined six different non-algebraic representations: Beginning of Sequence, Table, 
    Cobweb Diagram, Graph, Arrow Chain, and Arrow Diagram.  These representations can be seen in 
    <xref ref="fig-weigand-beginning-sequence"/>, <xref ref="fig-weigand-table-cobweb"/>, 
    <xref ref="fig-weigand-graph-arrow-chain"/>, and <xref ref="fig-weigand-arrow-diagram"/>.

  <p>
    In these representations, the numerical view of sequence was embodied primarily in the <em>Beginning of 
    Sequence</em> and <em>Table</em> format while the geometric view was primarily embodied within the 
    <em>Cobweb Diagram</em>, <em>Graph</em>, and <em>Arrow Chain</em> diagrams.  What is interesting is that 
    from a geometric perspective, the cobweb and arrow representations were not effective in relating the 
    representation to the sequence.  These were viewed primarily as pictorial descriptions rather than 
    relationships.  For someone already familiar with the concept of iterative sequences, the cobweb diagram 
    makes sense and can lend additional meaning to the user, but to the newcomer, it adds little and in fact, 
    can lead to incorrect mathematical interpretations (Weigand, 1991).  Although Weigand's results cannot 
    definitively explain why the geometric representations apart from the graphs were not effective in 
    connecting the representation to the relations involved in the sequence, one might speculate that it may be 
    related to the lack of exposure to such representations.  Weigand suggests that in order for students to 
    deepen their understanding of a concept such as iterative sequences, “[they] must also be given the 
    opportunity to use this variety of representations.  When teaching using these elements, the computer can 
    be an indispensable aid and tool” (p. 433).
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to help students develop reasoning skills related to a concept, it is also important that the 
    teacher is aware of how students make use of representations.  As Weigand found, the teachers and students 
    applied different methods of thinking.  The teachers tended to use more formal mathematical thinking 
    strategies while the students made use of informal approaches involving different representations.  It is 
    crucial that teachers not ignore the ways in which students think as they plan instruction.  Weigand 
    suggests that his results support the demand typically given to symbolic representations in contrast to 
    iconic ones within the classroom since, to the teacher, the goal is to move in the direction of symbolic 
    forms.
  </p>

  <p>
    So what are the advantages and disadvantages of different representations?  While the numerical 
    representations found in Weigand's beginning of sequence and table formats offer views of the actual value 
    to which a sequence is converging, these representations do little to offer insight into an overall 
    behavior of a sequence.  Weigand found that unsuccessful students tended to use the numerical forms; 
    beginning of sequence and table representations, and did not use any graphical representations at all.  He 
    found that for most solutions strategies, students needed to deal with comparisons of sequences with 
    different initial values.  The numerical representations force students to do a comparison of terms on a 
    one-by-one basis.  In contrast, the graphical representations provide comparison of many terms in a single 
    view allowing broader patterns to be detected.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even though the graphical representation allows the students to see the sequence behavior from a broader 
    perspective, Weigand also reports that students still had difficulty connecting the properties of the 
    function used to generate the iterative sequence and the iterative sequence itself.  In this case, students 
    did see the iterative sequence as a functional relationship, but described the properties of the sequence 
    dynamically with no connection to the recursive nature of the sequence's origin or the properties of the 
    generating function.  The result of this disconnected view of sequence iteration is that students “hardly 
    used arguments which could be applied to all iteration sequences” (Weigand, 1991, p. 434).
  </p>

  <p>
    So how do we help students view commonalities that might apply to iteration sequences in general?  One of 
    the challenges is to help students make broader observations with respect to sequence behavior.  Just as 
    the graphical representation gave a broader perspective of the sequence behavior in comparison to the 
    numerical representation in Weigand's study, we need to find a way to allow a “bigger view” of multiple 
    graphical representations as parameters in the situation change in order to give a broader perspective of 
    change across situations.  Lapp and St. John (2009) describe just such an environment where students notice 
    patterns across multiple graphical representations as parameters in the situation change.  The key to 
    describing the change of changing graphs lies in dynamically linked representations where the change in one 
    triggers real-time change in the others.  In this case, students have the graph and algebraic representation 
    of the generating function appearing on one side of a viewing window and the graph of the scatter plot of 
    the iterative sequence on the other side of the same viewing window (see 
    <xref ref="fig-lapp-stjohn-dynamic-sequence"/>).  Here the graph of the generating function can be grabbed 
    and pulled resulting in changes in both the graphical and algebraic representations of the function.  As 
    the graph is manipulated, the scatter plot of the iterative sequence dynamically changes in the same field 
    of view.  This use of technology allows students to not only see the sequence behavior, but also the 
    corresponding behavior of the function that creates the sequence, thus addressing a problem found with 
    students in Weigand's study.

    </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    While the graphical representations can help students notice patterns, in mathematics, we do rely on 
    algebraic reasoning for proving properties in a general sense.  A concern for the lack of connection to 
    algebraic representations is voiced by Alcock and Simpson (2004).  In this study, some students who used 
    graphical representations maintained a strong sense that they understood the concepts.  The problem was 
    that some of these students did not feel a need to examine the more formal representations used for proof.  
    Alcock and Simpson did find that some students who relied on visual or graphical representations made 
    connections to algebraic properties, but these students tended to be students whose “beliefs about learning 
    mathematics prompt them to seek overall integration of both visual and algebraic/verbal representations of 
    the material” (p. 29).  The students who seem to be motivated to seek such integration tended to have a 
    stronger sense of internal authority with respect to mathematics.  The students who did not seek 
    integration tended to have an external sense of authority where mathematics is viewed as a set of 
    conventions and procedures to be learned.
  </p>

  <p>
    The lesson to be learned from this is that we need to help students develop a sense of internal authority 
    so that they will more naturally seek integration of informal and formal representations.  Accomplishing 
    this task of motivating a sense of internal authority can be a challenge.  One suggestion is to transition 
    from guided discovery to inquiry teaching by asking appropriate questions until students begin to ask those 
    questions themselves.  Connecting algebraic reasoning to graphical behavior is also described by Lapp and 
    St. John (2009).  Here students are asked specifically to explain the graphical behavior they have observed 
    in terms of algebraic representations.  The students in this case used the computer algebra system to 
    extend the patterns to algebraic representations and then reason from those representations 
    (see <xref ref="fig-lapp-stjohn-algebraic-reasoning"/>).  Alcock and Simpson (2004) suggest this same 
    approach when they state, “in order to help other visualizing students build on their existing strengths, we 
    need to think about ways to have them engage in work that will help them to build such links” (p. 30).
  </p>

        <shortdescription>Algebraic Reasoning to Justify the Observed Patterns</shortdescription>
      </image>
    </figure>
  </p>

  <p>
    In summary, we suggest a need to use dynamically connected representations in conjunction with a move 
    toward inquiry approaches to teaching.  The literature suggests a need to engage students in “doing” 
    mathematics while using many representations.  Our perspective is that when students can view the technology 
    as a tool for investigation, autonomy in the problem-solving process will be more likely.  If the students 
    can easily move between representations and the teacher models such movement, we can empower the students 
    to become self-learners relying on an internal sense of authority.
