  <title>Introduction to Sequences</title>
<introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec12-ccss-content-overview"/>, we looked at the CCSS and noted that young learners tended 
      be adept at analyzing patterns.  Sequences are a type of pattern that can take on many representations and 
      can allow for various approaches by students for analyzing and solving them.  For this reason, this 
      section will examine how students see sequences from both a mathematical and pedagogical perspective.  
      While there are many different kinds of sequences, we will focus primarily on arithmetic, geometric, 
      figurative, and recursive sequences.  We will ground our discussion in some classroom excerpts where 
      students are grappling with patterns and also address how the students begin to represent these patterns 
      and the effect this has on their thinking.

    To begin, consider <em>The Border Problem: Part 1</em> found in <em>Connecting Mathematical Ideas: 
    Middle School Video Cases to Support Teaching and Learning (2005)</em> by Jo Boaler and Cathy Humphreys.  
    In this video case, students are exploring the pattern for finding the number of shaded squares along 
    the outer edge of a <m>10 \times 10</m> square as seen in
