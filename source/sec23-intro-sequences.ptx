  <title>Introduction to Sequences</title>
<introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec12-ccss-overview"/>, we looked at the CCSS and noted that young learners tended 
      be adept at analyzing patterns.  Sequences are a type of pattern that can take on many representations and 
      can allow for various approaches by students for analyzing and solving them.  For this reason, this 
      section will examine how students see sequences from both a mathematical and pedagogical perspective.  
      While there are many different kinds of sequences, we will focus primarily on arithmetic, geometric, 
      figurative, and recursive sequences.  We will ground our discussion in some classroom excerpts where 
      students are grappling with patterns and also address how the students begin to represent these patterns 
      and the effect this has on their thinking.  To begin, we should define what we mean by a sequence.

            A <em>sequence</em> is a list of terms <m>a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots</m>, given in a specific order.  
            These sequenced values can also be thought of as a function of the term number, <m>n</m>, and 
            denoted as <m>a_n</m>.  For the practical use of a computer algebra system, we often express the 
            terms using function notation, <m>a\left(n\right)</m>, so that we can define it in the CAS and 
            operate on its terms.  To express the entire sequence we often use the notation, 
            <m>\left \{a_n \right \}</m>, since we can think of the entire sequence as a list such as 
            <m>\left \{a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\right \}</m>.

    To begin, consider <em>The Border Problem: Part 1</em> found in <em>Connecting Mathematical Ideas: 
    Middle School Video Cases to Support Teaching and Learning (2005)</em> by Jo Boaler and Cathy Humphreys.  
    In this video case, students are exploring the pattern for finding the number of small shaded squares along 
    the outer edge of a larger <m>10 \times 10</m> square as seen in <xref ref="fig-border-10-10"/>.

          Watch the classroom episode of Cathy Humphreys' 7th grade class working on ways to find the border 
          of a square grid.  This video is found in the book, <em>Connecting Mathematical Ideas: Middle School 
          Video Cases to Support Teaching and Learning (2005)</em> by Jo Boaler and Cathy Humphreys.  You may 
          want to follow along with the provided transcript (pp. 1-5) from Boaler and Humphreys (2005) in 
          case you have a hard time discerning what is being said.

            The teacher, Cathy, in the episode allows for several different students to explain their way of 
            determining the total number of squares and she writes their method on the board with numerical 
            representations that align with the method.  For example, Sharmeen shares her thinking, "Well, first 
            I started out with forty from ten times four and then I subtracted four from that because there would 
            be four squares overlapping, and so that got thirty-six.".  Here Cathy writes on the board 
            <m>4 \times 10 -4</m>.  At this point, Cathy asks the questions, "And the four was for ...?", and 
            "OK. And this four was for?".  Discuss in your groups why you think Cathy chose this move in the 
            lesson?  From an algebraic standpoint, what is she trying to set up for later discussion?

      <task>

            Cathy then asks Colin to go up to the front and show his method.  Colin shares, "Anyway, so I, like, 
            I know this side is ten so I just did like ten and then this one, this one's the overlapping one, so 
            then this would be nine, then this one would be nine, too, because this one's overlapping. And then 
            for this, one it'd be eight because these two, this one is being used by this one and this one is 
            being used by that one."  As Colin explains, Cathy writes on the board, <m>10+9+9+8</m>.  In looking 
            at Sharmeen's and Colin's representations, how do you see them as the same?  How are they different?  
            Is there a way to move from one to the other in a way that makes <em>physical</em> sense?

            Toward the end of the lesson, Cathy asks the students to imagine shrinking the <m>10 \times 10</m> 
            square into a <m>6 \times 6</m> square.  She then asks them to use whatever method they want from 
            those previously discussed to determine the number of border square in the <m>6 \times 6</m> square.  
            In your groups, discuss why you think Cathy asked this question and where you think she is going with 
            this task?

    Now that we have speculated about Cathy's plan for her class, let's see where she takes the discussion on the 
    next day.  In the next activity, pay attention to the way Cathy tries to draw connections between the 
    physical representations of border squares and the way the computations are taking place.

          Watch the continuation of the classroom episode of Cathy Humphreys' 7th grade class working on ways to 
          find the border of a square grid.  This video is found in the book,

            In the episode, Cathy asks the question, "What's staying the same in this arithmetic?".  Here Cathy is 
            using the expression, <m>10+10+8+8</m>. In your groups, discuss why you think Cathy is asking this 
            question?  What is she trying to accomplish with this question with respect to Kaput, Blanton, and 
            Moreno's model?

              In looking at Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno (see <xref ref="fig-kaput-blanton-moreno"/>), how do 
              learners transition to new representation systems?

            At this stage of the discussion, Sarah responds by saying, "Well, the first two numbers are the same 
            numbers and the last two numbers are the same numbers.".  Cathy then has the students work in their 
            groups to try and find a way to represent the general process for computing the number of border 
            squares.  In her group, Sharmeen, shares, "S and so <m>s+s+\left(s-2\right)+\left(s-2\right)</m>. 
            Though that's kind of complicated. Is there any other way to put it?".  Given Sharmeen's original 
            method from the day before (<m>4 \times 10-4</m>), what question might you ask Sharmeen to help her 
            link her current method to her previoous one?

            As the discussion progresses, students share ways to represent the computation using more than one 
            variable.  Recall that on the first day of The Border Problem, Cathy made an intentional effort to 
            list all student approaches on the board with 
            <me>
              4 \times 10 -4
            </me>
            <me>
              10+9+9+8
            </me>
            <me>
              10+10+8+8
            </me>
            <me>
              \left(10 \times 10\right)-\left(8 \times 8\right)
            </me>
            <me>
              4 \times 8 +4
            </me>
            In your groups, discuss how these multiple representations might play a role in transitioning the 
            class to use only one variable.  What will eventually happen with the expresions if all of the 
            methods use the same variable to represent the "10" from the <m>10 \times 10</m> square computation?  
            How can Cathy leverage these expressions to help the students see they are the same?  What does the 
            "8" represent in Sharmeen's first symbolic expression?
