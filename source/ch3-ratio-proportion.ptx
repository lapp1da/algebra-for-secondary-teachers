  <title>Ratio and Proportional Reasoning</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      The Common Core State Standards use the phrase <em>Ratios and Proportional Relationships</em> to describe 
      concepts that are associated with ratios used to describe relationships between quantities (e.g. 2:3 or as 
      a fraction, <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>).  When two quantities maintain the same relationship we say that they are 
      proportional (e.g. 2:3 is equivalent to 4:6 or as fractions, <m>\frac{2}{3}=\frac{4}{6}</m>).  In this 
      chapter, we will examine how these ideas develop in learners and extend them to rates of change and scaling.
