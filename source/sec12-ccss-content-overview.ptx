  <title>Common Core State Standards for Mathematics: Content Standards</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The <em>Common Core State Standards for Mathematics</em> (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010) are broken into two areas.  
      When most people think of mathematics standards, the first things that come to mind are usually standards 
      related to what mathematics will be taught.  We refer to these as the 
      <em>Standards for Mathematical Content</em> or more simply, the <em>Content Standards</em>.  Since 
      this is the most common expectation, in this section, we will discuss it first.  However, the other 
      equally-important part of the CCSS are the <em>Standards for Mathematical Practice</em> that lay out the 
      expectations for "habits of mind" that we need students to have in order to do mathematics.  We will adress 
      these <em>Math Practices</em> in the next section.

    The Content Standards are broken down by grade level for the K-8 grades, but then are arranged by content 
    areas once we get to high school.  The standards are organized into domains that progress over several 
    grades so that it is easier to see learning trajectories and expectations as students move through the 
    curriculum.  For each grade in the K-8 band, the grade begins with generally 2 to 4 focal points to show 
    the broader goals for that particular grade.  Since at the high school level, students in various grades may 
    be taking different mathematics classes than their counterparts, standards are presented by conceptual 
    theme (<em>Number and Quantity</em>, <em>Algebra</em>, <em>Functions</em>, <em>Modeling</em>, 
    <em>Geometry</em>, <em>Statistics and Probability</em>).
  </p>

  <p>
    The Content Standards are more specific and define what students should understand and be able to do and 
    thus are the most refined categorization.  Since many of these standards are linked, the standards are then 
    organized into <em>Clusters</em> which are groups of related standards.  <em>Domains</em> are then larger 
    groups that progress across grades.
