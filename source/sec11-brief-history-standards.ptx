  <title>A Brief History of Standards for Mathematics Education: Algebraic Perspectives</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
    Although the <em>Principle and Standards for School Mathematics</em> (PSSM) (NCTM, 2000) and the 
    <em>Common Core State Standards</em> (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010) treat algebra as a standard for PreK-12, 
    society tends to view algebra as a part of mathematics relegated to the secondary curriculum.  In fact, 
    even mathematicians often fail to understand how algebra could be taught to a first grader.  Why is there 
    such a misunderstanding between organizations such as NCTM and society?  Why is there such a misunderstanding 
    between NCTM and the mathematics community?  Perhaps in order to understand why these differences in the 
    perception of algebra exist, we must first look at the historical and traditional teaching of algebra in 
    the United States.

      Suppose you were to ask the person on the street to describe algebra.  What sort of response would you get?  
      What about mathematics in general?  This question was asked of a student from a Minnesota high school during 
      ABC's <em>Primetime Live</em> following the release of the results from the Third International Mathematics 
      and Science Study (ABC News, 1998).  In response to this question she replied, “It's kind of a set in stone.  
      It's procedure.  It's a formula.  You learn the formula and you know how to do math.”

      Her perceptions of mathematics and, in particular, algebra, are not unique.  In fact, the argument could 
      be made that this is the perception of the majority of people—even those who are well educated.  So, we 
      must ask the question of why do so many people view mathematics as a set of procedures to be memorized?  
      This question is of particular interest as we explore the teaching and learning of algebra since so many 
      algebra texts are structured in such a way as to perpetuate this view.

    <p>
      Think back to your own algebra courses.  What were the items you remember most from your textbooks?  Can 
      you recall shaded boxes housing formulae and “rules”?  Do you recall the “Laws of Exponents” prominently 
      displayed on the page?  Did you ever think to question them?  Or did you ever wonder why they were 
      presented in the text before any examples like <m>a^2 \cdot a^3=a^5</m> were even discussed?  Maybe this 
      is the reason society holds a very procedural and limited view of algebra.
