  <title>A Brief History of Standards for Mathematics Education: Algebraic Perspectives</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
    Although the <em>Principle and Standards for School Mathematics</em> (PSSM) (NCTM, 2000) and the 
    <em>Common Core State Standards</em> (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010) treat algebra as a standard for PreK-12, 
    society tends to view algebra as a part of mathematics relegated to the secondary curriculum.  In fact, 
    even mathematicians often fail to understand how algebra could be taught to a first grader.  Why is there 
    such a misunderstanding between organizations such as NCTM and society?  Why is there such a misunderstanding 
    between NCTM and the mathematics community?  Perhaps in order to understand why these differences in the 
    perception of algebra exist, we must first look at the historical and traditional teaching of algebra in 
    the United States.

      Much of why we see slow advancement of educational practice is that humans are often change-averse.  
      For example, consider the "traditional" secondary curriculum consisting of the sequence of courses: 
      Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, and PreCalculus.  Why are these courses in the sequence that they are?  
      Doesn't seem odd that Geometry is sandwiched between Algebra 1 and 2?  Why are the subareas of mathematics 
      separate at all?  As it turns out, tradition is the real reason we see approaches like integrated curricula 
      (which have much support from research) mounting so much resistance.  The current sequence of Algebra 1, 
      Geometry, Algebra 2, and PreCalculus actually dates back to 1894.  Let me say that again, <em>1894</em>!  
      In 1894, the National Education Association (NEA) was dealing with the fact that very few students completed 
      high school.  There was a desire to make sure as many students as possible had some exposure to both algebra 
      and geometry before leaving school.  The solution <m>-</m> teach Algebra 1 followed immediately by Geometry.  
      This means that the typical student would see both by the end of the sophomore year when they might leave 
      formal education.  So to sum things up, the current system typically used for secondary mathematics 
      curricula dates back to a time over 125 years ago where the motivation was the fact that very few students 
      finished high school.  For this reason, as educators, we should always be asking ourselves why we do what we 
      do?  We need to look at the research and ask if the assumptions we make are still valid assumptions.

      Suppose you were to ask the person on the street to describe algebra.  What sort of response would you get?  
      What about mathematics in general?  This question was asked of a student from a Minnesota high school during 
      ABC's <em>Primetime Live</em> following the release of the results from the Third International Mathematics 
      and Science Study (ABC News, 1998).  In response to this question she replied, “It's kind of a set in stone.  
      It's procedure.  It's a formula.  You learn the formula and you know how to do math.”

      Her perceptions of mathematics and, in particular, algebra, are not unique.  In fact, the argument could 
      be made that this is the perception of the majority of people—even those who are well educated.  So, we 
      must ask the question of why do so many people view mathematics as a set of procedures to be memorized?  
      This question is of particular interest as we explore the teaching and learning of algebra since so many 
      algebra texts are structured in such a way as to perpetuate this view.
    </p>

    <p>
      Think back to your own algebra courses.  What were the items you remember most from your textbooks?  Can 
      you recall shaded boxes housing formulae and “rules”?  Do you recall the “Laws of Exponents” prominently 
      displayed on the page?  Did you ever think to question them?  Or did you ever wonder why they were 
      presented in the text before any examples like <m>a^2 \cdot a^3=a^5</m> were even discussed?  Maybe this 
      is the reason society holds a very procedural and limited view of algebra.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this text, we will explore not only the teaching and learning of algebra, but also the very nature of 
      this branch of mathematics.  If we wish to understand how students learn mathematics, we must first ask 
      questions about the nature of the mathematics to be learned.  If mathematics indeed is a set of procedures 
      to be memorized as suggested in the quote given above, then there are certain strategies that can be 
      employed to facilitate the memorization.  This would then be an appropriate method of teaching.  However, 
      if the nature of mathematics is far more than the memorization of a set of rules, the strategies employed 
      for learning mathematics will be completely different from those employed for memorization.

      Traditionally, mathematical content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge have been the main parts 
      of a dichotomous preparation program for teachers.  Research suggests that this approach to the preparation 
      of teachers is inadequate.  How can we separate mathematics and the teaching and learning of mathematics?  
      Is it possible to learn how to teach devoid of specific content knowledge?  If so, then this would suggest 
      that students learn language, social studies, art, science, and mathematics all the same way.  The 
      literature suggests otherwise.  So, if students learn different subjects differently, why do we tend to 
      separate the mathematical content for preservice teachers from the pedagogical content?  It is our opinion 
      that both mathematical content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge need to develop simultaneously.  
      For this reason, we will take a unified approach to integrate mathematical learning with the theories and 
      practice for teaching.
