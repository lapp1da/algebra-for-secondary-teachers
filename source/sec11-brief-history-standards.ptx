  <title>A Brief History of Standards for Mathematics Education: Algebraic Perspectives</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
    Although the <em>Principle and Standards for School Mathematics</em> (PSSM) (NCTM, 2000) and the 
    <em>Common Core State Standards</em> (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010) treat algebra as a standard for PreK-12, 
    society tends to view algebra as a part of mathematics relegated to the secondary curriculum.  In fact, 
    even mathematicians often fail to understand how algebra could be taught to a first grader.  Why is there 
    such a misunderstanding between organizations such as NCTM and society?  Why is there such a misunderstanding 
    between NCTM and the mathematics community?  Perhaps in order to understand why these differences in the 
    perception of algebra exist, we must first look at the historical and traditional teaching of algebra in 
    the United States.

    <p>
      Much of why we see slow advancement of educational practice is that humans are often change-averse.  
      For example, consider the "traditional" secondary curriculum consisting of the sequence of courses: 
      Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, and PreCalculus.  Why are these courses in the sequence that they are?  
      Doesn't it seem odd that Geometry is sandwiched between Algebra 1 and 2?  Why are the subareas of mathematics 
      separate at all?  As it turns out, tradition is the real reason we see approaches like integrated curricula 
      (which have much support from research) mounting so much resistance.  The current sequence of Algebra 1, 
      Geometry, Algebra 2, and PreCalculus actually dates back to 1894.  Let me say that again, <em>1894</em>!  
      In 1894, the National Education Association (NEA) was dealing with the fact that very few students completed 
      high school.  There was a desire to make sure as many students as possible had some exposure to both algebra 
      and geometry before leaving school.  The solution — teach Algebra 1 followed immediately by Geometry.  
      This means that the typical student would see both by the end of the sophomore year when they might leave 
      formal education (Reys and Reys, 2009; NEA, 1894).  So to sum things up, the current system typically used for secondary mathematics 
      curricula dates back to a time over 125 years ago where the motivation was the fact that very few students 
      finished high school.  For this reason, as educators, we should always be asking ourselves why we do what we 
      do?  We need to look at the research and ask if the assumptions we make are still valid assumptions.  The 
      reasons, "Because that's the way we've always done it" or "Because that's the way I learned it" are not 
      sufficient for rational decision making.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Given that our current curricular structure exists for reasons that are no longer relevant, we are faced with 
      the reality that old choices also shape current perception of the mathematics we teach.  For algebra, we 
      need to ask the questions of what is algebra and why do we view it as we do, before we can address how best 
      to teach it.  Suppose you were to ask the person on the street to describe algebra.  What sort of response 
      would you get?  What about mathematics in general?  This question was asked of a student from a Minnesota 
      high school during ABC's <em>Primetime Live</em> following the release of the results from the Third 
      International Mathematics and Science Study (ABC News, 1998).  In response to this question she replied, 
      “It's kind of a set in stone.  It's procedure.  It's a formula.  You learn the formula and you know how 
      to do math.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Her perceptions of mathematics and, in particular, algebra, are not unique.  In fact, the argument could 
      be made that this is the perception of the majority of people — even those who are well educated.  So, we 
      must ask the question of why do so many people view mathematics as a set of procedures to be memorized?  
      This question is of particular interest as we explore the teaching and learning of algebra since so many 
      algebra texts are structured in such a way as to perpetuate this view.
    </p>

    <p>
      Think back to your own algebra courses.  What were the items you remember most from your textbooks?  Can 
      you recall shaded boxes housing formulae and “rules”?  Do you recall the “Laws of Exponents” prominently 
      displayed on the page?  Did you ever think to question them?  Or did you ever wonder why they were 
      presented in the text before any examples like <m>a^2 \cdot a^3=a^5</m> were even discussed?  Maybe this 
      is the reason society holds a very procedural and limited view of algebra.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this text, we will explore not only the teaching and learning of algebra, but also the very nature of 
      this branch of mathematics.  If we wish to understand how students learn mathematics, we must first ask 
      questions about the nature of the mathematics to be learned.  If mathematics indeed is a set of procedures 
      to be memorized as suggested in the quote given above, then there are certain strategies that can be 
      employed to facilitate the memorization.  This would then be an appropriate method of teaching.  However, 
      if the nature of mathematics is far more than the memorization of a set of rules, the strategies employed 
      for learning mathematics will be completely different from those employed for memorization.
    </p>

    <p>
      Traditionally, mathematical content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge have been the main parts 
      of a dichotomous preparation program for teachers.  Research suggests that this approach to the preparation 
      of teachers is inadequate.  How can we separate mathematics and the teaching and learning of mathematics?  
      Is it possible to learn how to teach devoid of specific content knowledge?  If so, then this would suggest 
      that students learn language, social studies, art, science, and mathematics all the same way.  While there 
      are many common aspects of teaching and learning that resonate across many subject disciplines, the 
      literature suggests that some disciplines have nuanced processes for learning that differ from other 
      disciplines.  So, if students learn different subjects differently, why do we tend to separate the 
      mathematical content for preservice teachers from the pedagogical content?  It is our opinion 
      that both mathematical content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge need to develop simultaneously.  
      For this reason, we will take a unified approach to integrate mathematical learning with the theories and 
      practice for teaching.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have now stated our position as it relates to the integration of mathematical and pedagogical content 
      knowledge, but how should this integration be accomplished?  In order to develop both mathematical and 
      pedagogical content knowledge simultaneously, we first must ask ourselves how we come to know either of 
      these.  To this end, we now discuss the theoretical model that guides our approach and this text.

  <title>Pirie and Kieren Model for Mathematical Understanding</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
    In order to understand the significance of both the explorations and the reflective practice combined in 
    this text, we first will give an overview of the theoretical framework guiding our approach to the 
    integration of mathematical and pedagogical content knowledge.  We have adopted the theory of growth of 
    mathematical understanding put forth by Pirie and Kieren (1994) as our model for these materials and this 
    will guide both the mathematical learning experiences and the pedagogical reflection in which the reader 
    will engage throughout this course.  In addition, we will later utilize Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno's (2008) 
    model that elaborates on the mechanisms at play as a learner moves through the levels found in the Pirie 
    and Kieren model from a symbolic (or semiotic) point of view.

    and Kieren model from a symbolic (or semiotic) point of view.

  <p>
    In the Pirie and Kieren model, the growth of mathematical understanding occurs throughout eight levels.  
    We are careful here to use the word “throughout” since we do not want to give the impression that these 
    levels are linear.  In fact, their theory characterizes mathematical growth as a whole, dynamic, leveled 
    but nonlinear, transcendently recursive process (Kieren and Pirie, 1991).  The Pirie and Kieren model is 
    an elaboration of the constructivist view of understanding as a continuing organization of knowledge 
    structures as described by von Glasersfeld (1987), but we must also consider that we have the ability to 
    influence and shape each others understanding because learning is a social process (Vygotsky, 1978).  
    Freeman et al. (2014) suggest that active learning where students are engaged in experiences rather than 
    passively listening to an instructor promotes greater depth of understanding and so we will take this 
    approach in this text.  In addition, communication also plays a role in our thinking as Sfard (2008) suggests 
    and so we need to be mindful of these dynamically linked components of learning if we are to create an 
    environment where exploration and student autonomy are key parts of concept development.
