</h3>
<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">Suppose you are teaching a high school Algebra 1 class and are tasked with teaching factoring trinomials into a product of two binomials?  How might you start?  Traditionally, the teacher would show many examples where they perform this process and then the students are given some trinomials to practice.  The problem with this approach is that it is promoting mimicking and not thinking.  So how might we change this instructional sequence to better promote thinking and reasoning so that the student discover the process we want them to do as opposed to purely memorize it?</div>

<article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h4>
<div class="para">In front of you, you have a physical set of algebra tiles (or you can use the virtual ones above in <a href="sec41-what-is-algebra.html#fig-algebra-tiles-interactive" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-algebra-tiles-interactive.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 4.1.4">Figure 4.1.4</a>).  Using the variable length tiles, "<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>", along with unit tiles, try to form a rectangle with length, <span class="process-math">\(x+2\text{,}\)</span> on one side and length, <span class="process-math">\(x+3\text{,}\)</span> on the other side.  On your whiteboards, draw a sketch of your area model labeling the tiles you used to fill in the rectangle.  How many of each type of tile did you use to fill in the rectangle?  What polynomial would the resulting rectangle represent and how are the numbers of each type of tile in your rectangle related to the coefficients of your polynomial?</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h4>
<div class="para">Now consider the product, <span class="process-math">\(\left(x+1\right) \left(2x+3\right)\text{.}\)</span>  Model this product in the same way as in part (a).  On your whiteboards, draw a sketch of your area model labeling the tiles you used to fill in the rectangle.  How many of each type of tile did you use to fill in the rectangle?  What polynomial would the resulting rectangle represent  and how are the numbers of each type of tile in your rectangle related to the coefficients of your polynomial?</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h4>
<div class="para">Now let’s turn this process around.  Suppose we start with the result of <span class="process-math">\(x^2+7x+6\text{.}\)</span>  Take out one <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> tile, seven <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> tiles, and six units.  Try to arrange these tiles into a rectangle.  Draw a sketch of your rectangle on your whiteboards.  Compare your sketch with that of other groups.  Are they all the same?  If not, what are the differences?  What are the dimensions along each side of your rectangle and what product does this represent?</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h4>
<div class="para">Now try the same approach from part (c) to break down <span class="process-math">\(2x^2+11x+12\text{.}\)</span>  Try to arrange these tiles into a rectangle.

<div class="para">In both parts (c) and (d), summarize any patterns you see in where the component tiles ended up.  Pay particular attention to the location of the "<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>" tiles and the units.  How were they separated within the rectangle’s interior and how is this separation related to the coefficients in the original polynomial?</div></article></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec41-what-is-algebra.html#act-algebra-tiles">in-context</a></span>
