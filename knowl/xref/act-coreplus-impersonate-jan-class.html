<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">Now that you have started to reflect on the mathematics and pedagogy present in these explorations, consider the following classroom situation where a teacher (Jan) is questioned by her students.</div>
<div class="para">Jan has been teaching polynomials and factoring out of Lesson 2 of the <em class="emphasis">Contemporary Mathematics in Context: A Unified Approach (Core-Plus)</em> curriculum.  She assigned students to work on the “On Your Own” question found on page 385 of book 4B as well as the “Extending” questions found on pages 402-403 (see <a href="sec22-complex-numbers.html#fig-core-plus-on-your-own-1" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-core-plus-on-your-own-1.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 2.2.2">Figure 2.2.2</a> and <a href="sec22-complex-numbers.html#fig-core-plus-on-your-own-2" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-core-plus-on-your-own-2.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 2.2.3">Figure 2.2.3</a>).  During the next class period, she facilitated a discussion of the homework assignment.  Within the discussion, Jeff asked, “I was able to do the error function graphs and I understand that the longer the polynomial, the closer we get to matching the sine function, but how did they come up with those polynomial functions?  They all have weird coefficients and stuff.”</div>

<div class="para">Explain how you would respond to Jeff’s question.  Keep in mind that Jeff is in his fourth year of high school mathematics and has been exposed to the concept of derivative earlier in book 4A.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<div class="para">When we describe the shape and behavior of various functions, we often pay attention to features such as zeros, y-intercepts, slope, intervals of increasing/decreasing, concavity, etc.  Of these features, which do you consider to be the most relevant to Jeff’s question?</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Describe what type of investigation you might give your students to help them discover the strategy for constructing appropriate polynomials that imitate the sine function.  Be very specific and include actual questions you would give the students for investigation.</div></article></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec22-complex-numbers.html#act-coreplus-impersonate-jan-class">in-context</a></span>
