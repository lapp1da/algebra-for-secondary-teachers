</h4>
<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">Tim is a beginning teacher in his second year.  Today, he is teaching the concept of inverse function. To find an inverse function, the text that Tim is using begins by having the students swap the variables of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> and then solve for <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span>  He is fairly confident that he can teach his students how to use this procedure to find inverse functions, but also noted that the book has students check to see if the inverse function works by composing the two functions to see if the composition results in “x”.  Tim also noticed that the book covers function composition in the section before inverse function and assumes this is so that students can understand how to check their answers once they have found the inverse function.  Since he wants to be sure the students are ready, he begins class by discussing the previous day’s lesson on function composition.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Tim</em> : OK, let’s make sure we understand what we did yesterday since we are going to use it today.  What is composition of functions?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Jen</em> : Isn’t it just sticking one thing into another?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Tim</em> : Yes, it is.  Can anyone show us how to do it?  [<em class="emphasis">Lori raises her hand</em>].  Lori, go to the board.  Can anyone give us two functions?  [<em class="emphasis">Ken raises his hand</em>].  Ken, whatcha got?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Ken</em> : How about <span class="process-math">\(f\left(x\right)=3x-1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\left(x\right)=x^2+x\text{?}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Tim</em> : Great.  Now Lori, show us what to do.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Lori</em> : OK, I guess it depends on what order you want.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Tim</em> : Let’s do <span class="process-math">\(f\left(g\left(x\right)\right)\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Lori</em> : So we just take <span class="process-math">\(x^2+x\)</span> and stick it in for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(3x-1\text{.}\)</span>  That gives us <span class="process-math">\(3\left(x^2+x\right)-1\text{.}\)</span>  Now we can just distribute it out and that gives us <span class="process-math">\(3x^2+3x-1\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Tim</em> : Super!  Is everyone OK with that?  [<em class="emphasis">The class is quiet</em>].  Good, let’s move on to today’s stuff.  Thanks, Lori.  [<em class="emphasis">Lori sits down</em>].</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Tim</em> : Today we’re going to look at inverses when it comes to functions.  Has anyone ever heard the word “inverse” before?  [<em class="emphasis">Several hands go up</em>].  Yeah, Mia.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Mia</em> : Wouldn’t that just be like the flip of a function?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Tim</em> : [<em class="emphasis">Smiles</em>].  No, that’s a common mistake.  This is completely different when it comes to functions.  Let’s look at the book’s way of finding inverse functions.  In pairs, take a couple of minutes to read the procedure on page 213 (see <a href="sec43-inverses-undoing-structure.html#fig-tim-text-inverse-function" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-tim-text-inverse-function.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 4.3.3">Figure 4.3.3</a>).</div>

<div class="para">[<em class="emphasis">Students are given 5 minutes to read and discuss the procedure as Tim circulates observing their discussions.  Tim notices that in the pair of Mike and Sam, Mike seems to be doing most of the explaining and so plans to call on Mike.</em>]</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Tim</em> : Mike, in your own words explain how to find inverse functions.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Mike</em> : Well, first you just switch the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>s.  Then you just solve for <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is on one side of the equation and the other side just has <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>s.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Tim</em> : Very good.  Let’s do one together.  Let’s start with lines.  How about the function we used earlier, <span class="process-math">\(y=3x-1\text{.}\)</span>  Tell me what to do.  Yeah, Joan, get us started.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Joan</em> : First write it as <span class="process-math">\(x=3y-1\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Tim</em> : Now what?  Someone else [<em class="emphasis">Hiro raises his hand</em>].  Hiro go ahead.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Hiro</em> : Just add 1 to both sides to get <span class="process-math">\(x+1=3y\text{.}\)</span>  The only thing we have to do now is divide by 3 so we get <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> all by itself.  That gives us <span class="process-math">\(y=\frac{x+1}{3}\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Tim</em> : Excellent.  Does everyone see how it’s done?  [<em class="emphasis">Kat raises her hand</em>].  Yeah, Kat.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Kat</em> : How do we know it’s the inverse function?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Tim</em> : I’m glad you asked that, Kat.  That’s our next part of the lesson.  To see if it worked, we just think of these as functions and compose them like we did yesterday.  If we get “x”, then they are inverses.  Let’s try it.  OK, let’s make <span class="process-math">\(f\left(x\right)=3x-1\)</span> like we did before and now make <span class="process-math">\(g\left(x\right)=\frac{x+1}{3}\text{.}\)</span>  Sue, come to the board and work out this composition.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Sue</em> : [<em class="emphasis">Sue goes to the board and begins writing.</em>]  OK, we have <span class="process-math">\(f\left(g\left(x\right)\right)\text{.}\)</span>  That gives <span class="process-math">\(3\left(\frac{x+1}{3}\right)-1\text{.}\)</span>  We can cancel the 3s and that leaves just <span class="process-math">\(x+1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(-1\text{.}\)</span>  The 1 and -1 cancel and we get <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Tim</em> : Great.  Do you see, Kat?  Since we got <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> that means they’re inverses.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Kat</em> : I’m still not sure how you know they’re inverses?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Tim</em> : Well, we got <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>  If you compose a function and its inverse you get <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Let’s do a few more and that might help with remembering it.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Kat</em> : But why do we get <span class="process-math">\(x\text{?}\)</span>  Why don’t we get 1?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Tim</em> : That’s just the definition of what it means to be an inverse function.  Just follow these steps and you’ll be OK.</div>
