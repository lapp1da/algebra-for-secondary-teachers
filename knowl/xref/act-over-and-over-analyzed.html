<div class="introduction"><div class="para">In looking at the IMP activity, <em class="emphasis">Over, and Over, and Over, and...</em>, we noticed that in some cases iteration converged, but in other cases we had divergence.  Instead of looking at specific linear functions, here we will take a look at the general case for <span class="process-math">\(f\left(x\right)=mx+b\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">On your CAS, define the function, <span class="process-math">\(f\left(x\right)=m \cdot x+b\text{.}\)</span>  Note that on most CAS, you need to make sure to use the multiplication operator between the <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> since we could easily name a variable with a multi-letter name.  Now use your CAS to evalute and obtain expressions for <span class="process-math">\(f\left(x\right)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f\left(f\left(x\right)\right)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f\left(f\left(f\left(x\right)\right)\right)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f\left(f\left(f\left(f\left(x\right)\right)\right)\right)\text{.}\)</span>  Describe any patterns you see in the expressions.</div>

<div class="para">Based on your observations, we want to prove that your conjecture for <span class="process-math">\(f^n\left(x\right)\)</span> is always true.  Proof by induction is a means to do this.  Essentially, you assume it is true for the <span class="process-math">\(k^{th}\)</span> iteration and then try to show it is true for the <span class="process-math">\(\left(k+1\right)^{st}\)</span> case. Based on your expression from part (b), assume the form of <span class="process-math">\(f^k\left(x\right)\)</span> and plug <span class="process-math">\(x=mx+b\)</span> in for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in your expression and rearrange the terms.  Do you get the same thing as if you replaced all of the <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> in your <span class="process-math">\(f^k\left(x\right)\)</span> expression with <span class="process-math">\(k+1\text{?}\)</span>  If so, you have shown that you can always get to the next largest <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> value and so this will continue to infinity.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Now that we have established that your expression for <span class="process-math">\(f^n\left(x\right)\)</span> will always work, we need to find when this will converge and when it will diverge.  Consider the long sum that is associated with <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> in your expression (a sum of powers of <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span>).  Based on what you know from geometric series (think back to Calculus 2), for what values of <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> will this series converge?</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h5>
<div class="para">If the sum in the term associated with <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> in your expression converges for your conditions on <span class="process-math">\(m\text{,}\)</span> will those same values of <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> also guarantee that the term involing the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> will also converge?
