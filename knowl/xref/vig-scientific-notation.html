</h3>
<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">Abby is teaching scientific notation as part of her 8th grade curriculum.  You can see the details from the Common Core State Standards <em class="emphasis">8.EE #4</em> as given in <a href="sec21-elementary-concepts-number.html#fig-ccss-scientific-notation" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-ccss-scientific-notation.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 2.1.1">Figure 2.1.1</a>.  She begins by discussing the process for converting back and forth between numbers written in standard Hindu-Arabic form and those written in scientific notation.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Abby</em> : Today we are going to look at another way to write numbers when they become so long that we really don’t need to use all of their digits.  When a number gets so big, the digits closest to the units really don’t matter so much.  Suppose you are Elon Musk and you decide to buy a new jet.  The jet costs $200,000,000.  Further suppose Mr. Musk is currently worth roughly $412 billion.  After the purchase of the jet, how much is Elon Musk worth?  Yes, Kate.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Kate</em> : $411.8 billion?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Abby</em> : Good, but let’s just keep it in whole billions.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Kate</em> : OK, $412 billion?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Abby</em> : Nice!  So did his purchase really matter much when it come to his wealth?  Toby?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Toby</em> : Not at all.  That’s like me worrying about fifty cents.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Abby</em> : So what we are going to talk about today is called scientific notation and it’s used when numbers are so big that we don’t really need to worry about all the digits.  Suppose we are looking at the number 372400.  Instead of writing all of the digits, we can instead write it as a power of 10.  If move the decimal point to the left until it is between the 3 and the 7 and count how many places we move it [<em class="emphasis">Abby writes the number placing the decimal point at the far right and then draws curved half circles under the digits to indicate movement of the decimal point from place to place, counting as she goes</em>], we can use the number of places we move it as the power of 10.  This means that <span class="process-math">\(372400=3.724 \times 10^5\text{.}\)</span>  So you just need to count the moves.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Mia</em> : Why are the moves the same as the power of 10?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Abby</em> : That’s just how we write the new notation to shorten it.  Let’s try another example for a really big number.  That might help.  How would you write 5,681,000,000,000 in scientific notation?  Yeah, Ja’miya.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Ja’miya</em> : Well, I guess we’d just count to get it between the 5 and 6, so let’s see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.  So twelve.  So would it be <span class="process-math">\(5.681 \times 10^{12}\text{?}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Abby</em> : Great.  Does that help, Mia?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Mia</em> : Not really.  I’m still not sure why the power of ten is the same as counting the moves.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Abby</em> : Well, let’s just practice a few more and see if that helps.</div>
