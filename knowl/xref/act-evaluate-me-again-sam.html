<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">You may have at one time used a scientific or standard calculator and entered an evaluation for <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> and then continued to press the [√] or [=] key only to see the decimal approximation eventually get closer and closer to 1.  This illustrates values of an infinite sequence where each element of the sequence is obtained by taking the previous element in the sequence and plugging it into a given function.  In this investigation we will explore such sequences and look for common properties.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Problem Statement</em>:  In the example given above, a specific function, <span class="process-math">\(f\left(x\right)=\sqrt{x}\text{,}\)</span> and a specific starting point, <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{,}\)</span> were used to generate the sequence.  In this exploration, consider a more general question.  Suppose you have a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and the infinite sequence, <span class="process-math">\(f\left(x_0\right), f\left(f\left(x_0\right)\right), f\left(f\left(f\left(x_0\right)\right)\right), \ldots\text{.}\)</span> In this exploration, we will examine this sequence for some specific families of functions and then generate more questions for further investigation.</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{Setting}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{Things}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{Up}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{to}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{Explore}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">Here we will use the <em class="emphasis">TI-Nspire CX II CAS</em>, but this can also be done with a variety of other computer algebra systems.  To begin, we will explore a very familiar function, <span class="process-math">\(f\left(x\right)=ax^2\text{,}\)</span> for various values of the parameter, <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span>  Open a new document and select <em class="emphasis">1:New Document</em>. When prompted, select <em class="emphasis">2:Add Graphs</em> to open a graphing screen.  Enter the function <span class="process-math">\(f_1\left(x\right)=x^2\)</span> in the command line at the bottom of the screen and press [enter] to display the graph.  You will be able to morph this graph later by grabbing it in order to explore the effect of the parameter, <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> on the sequence.</div>
<div class="para"><div class="image-box" style="width: 90%; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;"><img src="external/images/evaluate-sam-screens-1.png" class="contained" alt="1st set of screenshots"></div></div>
<div class="para">In order to observe the behavior of this sequence graphically, generate a sequence plot by plotting the term number vs. the iterate values.  To do this, insert a new page by pressing [ctrl] [+page] and then selecting <em class="emphasis">2:Add Graphs</em>.  In this case, you do not want to graph a function, but the sequence points.  To change the type of graph, press [menu] and then select <em class="emphasis">3:Graph Entry/Edit</em> followed by <em class="emphasis">7:Sequence</em> and <em class="emphasis">1:Sequence</em>.  You will notice that the command line at the top of the screen will change yielding fields into which you can enter the sequence relationship and initial value (see images below).  Since we want to generate an iterative sequence based on the function stored in <span class="process-math">\(f1\left(x\right)\text{,}\)</span> we enter <span class="process-math">\(u1\left(n\right)=f1\left(u1\left(n-1\right)\right)\)</span> so that the sequence plotter will use the function value of the pervious number in the sequence to generate the new number in the sequence.  Use 0.5 as your initial value for now.  You can adjust the viewing window by grabbing a tick mark on the axis by holding down the "click/grab" key located in the center of the NavPad (mouse pad) until the hand closes.  Dragging your finger across the NavPad will adjust the view.  If you want to adjust only one axis scale at a time, simply hold down the [shift] key while you move on the screen.  To adjust where the axes are located within the window, move to any open space in the graphing window and hold the "click/grab" key down until the hand closes, then move the entire graph to any location you desire (see images below).</div>
<div class="para"><div class="image-box" style="width: 90%; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;"><img src="external/images/evaluate-sam-screens-2.png" class="contained" alt="2nd set of screenshots"></div></div>
<div class="para"><div class="image-box" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"><img src="external/images/evaluate-sam-screens-3.png" class="contained" alt="3rd set of screenshots"></div></div>
<div class="para">In order to explore the relationship between the parameter, <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> and the behavior of the sequence, it will be helpful to view the function and the sequence plot side-by-side.  In order to do this press [+page] to insert a new page and then press [esc] since you do not wish to insert just one application, but two in a side-by-side layout.  Now press [doc] and select <em class="emphasis">5:Page Layout</em> and <em class="emphasis">2:Select Layout</em> followed by <em class="emphasis">2:Layout 2</em>.  This will give a side-by-side partitioned screen that will allow you to place a different application in each partition.</div>
<div class="para"><div class="image-box" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"><img src="external/images/evaluate-sam-screens-4.png" class="contained" alt="4th set of screenshots"></div></div>
<div class="para"><div class="image-box" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"><img src="external/images/evaluate-sam-screens-5.png" class="contained" alt="5th set of screenshots"></div></div>
<div class="para">In order to copy the graph page for both the function and the scatter plot, you must first select them.  Page back to the function graph by pressing [ctrl] followed by the left arrow until you get to the page you want.  Unfortunately you cannot just copy the page, but must “select” it first.  To do this, press [doc] and then select <em class="emphasis">5:Page Layout</em> followed by <em class="emphasis">3:Select App</em>.  In the future, the shortcut for selecting an application is [ctrl][K].  You will see the border of the screen begin to flash indicating it is selected.  Then press [ctrl][C] to copy it (just like on a computer). Now page back to the split screen by pressing [ctrl] followed by the right arrow until you reach it. To paste the graphing screen into the left side, just press [ctrl][V] (like paste on a computer).  To get the sequence plot pasted into the right side of the screen, repeat this process, but you will need to click on the right side of the screen to make it active before pasting.  You will know that a portion of the screen is active since it will have a darkened border around it (see screens below).</div>
<div class="para"><div class="image-box" style="width: 90%; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;"><img src="external/images/evaluate-sam-screens-6.png" class="contained" alt="6th set of screenshots"></div></div>
<div class="para">At this point you are ready to examine the effects of the parameter, <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> on the behavior of the sequence.  The side-by-side view of the two graphs allows you to manipulate the function and see the sequence plot change dynamically in real time.  To do this, move the cursor to the edge of the parabola until you see the dilation icon appear as shown below.  Press and hold the click key until the "hand" closes to grab the parabola then use the arrow keys to “morph” it.  To "let go" just press [esc].</div>
</div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Sketch the graphs for at least four different values of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(f\left(x\right)=ax^2\text{.}\)</span> Describe any patterns you may see.  Will the sequence always converge?</div> <div class="para">As you have seen, the parameter, <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> affects the behavior of the sequence.  Are there other factors that also affect the behavior of the sequence?  You may have already considered the possibility that the “seed”, or initial, value might also affect it.  At this point change the seed value and investigate how the parameter, <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> and the seed value interact.  You can change the seed by clicking in the sequence window and editing the initial term or by grabbing the initial point (green) in the sequence plot and moving it or editing it directly in the command line.  To make the command line visible, press [ctrl][G] or double click in any white space in the window.</div> <div class="para"><div class="image-box" style="width: 90%; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;"><img src="external/images/evaluate-sam-screens-7.png" class="contained" alt="7th set of screenshots"></div></div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Record your data for at least two other seed values and the corresponding different values of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> for each seed sketching your plots.  Does there appear to be a relationship between the seed and a? Describe any patterns you may see.</div> <div class="para">Since we will want to explore the effects of the seed value for multiple trials, it will make it easier to place an editable seed value on the graphing page.  To do this, on the graphing page containing the parabola, select [menu] and then <em class="emphasis">1:Actions</em> followed by <em class="emphasis">B:Insert Slider</em>.  Type the variable name, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{seed}\text{,}\)</span> into the slider <em class="emphasis">Variable</em> dialogue box and press [enter].  You can place the slider anywhere in the window and elongate it by grabbing the dot on either end.  To adjust the slider after it is set in place, click on the slider box and press [ctrl][menu] to open the attributes and select <em class="emphasis">1:Move</em> to move location or <em class="emphasis">2:Settings</em> and edit the settings as you wish. You can also change the slider settings to allow finer step sizes when dragging (below shows changing it to 0.01).</div> <div class="para"><div class="image-box" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"><img src="external/images/evaluate-sam-screens-8.png" class="contained" alt="8th set of screenshots"></div></div> <div class="para">Now to connect the slider to the sequence plot, edit the sequence plot setting as you did before so that the <em class="emphasis">Initial Term</em> simply reads, <em class="emphasis">seed</em>.  This will now allow you to change the seed value on the graphing page for the function.  You can also move the slider to a convenient place on the screen so that it is not interfering with the view of the graph.</div> <div class="para"><div class="image-box" style="width: 90%; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;"><img src="external/images/evaluate-sam-screens-9.png" class="contained" alt="9th set of screenshots"></div></div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Investigate other combinations of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and the <span class="process-math">\(seed\text{.}\)</span>  Record your data and sketches. Does there appear to be a relationship between the seed and <span class="process-math">\(a\text{?}\)</span> Describe any patterns you may see.  Based on your observations, can you predict whether or not the sequence will converge?</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Repeat your process from part (c) for another seed value recording your data and sketches.  Did your second choice of seed value confirm or refute any earlier conjectures?  Explain.</div> <div class="para">Although we may have a conjecture at this point, we still need to prove that this conjecture will always hold.  To accomplish this, we turn to the algebraic representation.  Open a new <em class="emphasis">Calculator</em> page by pressing [ctrl][+page] and selecting <em class="emphasis">1:Add Calculator</em>.  Define the function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> by pressing [menu] and selecting <em class="emphasis">1:Actions</em> followed by <em class="emphasis">1:Define</em>.  Then enter the function, <span class="process-math">\(f\left(x\right)=a\cdot x^2\)</span> keeping in mind that implied multiplication is not recognized between two letters and that you must use the [<span class="process-math">\(\times\)</span>] key.  We can explore a few cases for <span class="process-math">\(f\left(f\left(x\right)\right), f\left(f\left(f\left(x\right)\right)\right), \ldots\)</span> on the <em class="emphasis">Calculator</em> page (see below).</div> <div class="para"><div class="image-box" style="width: 40%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;"><img src="external/images/evaluate-sam-screens-10.png" class="contained" alt="10th set of screenshots"></div></div> <div class="para">Since the spreadsheet in the CAS allows symbolic entries, we can use the <em class="emphasis">Generate Sequence</em> feature to look at repeated iterations of the function composition.  To do this, insert a new <em class="emphasis">4:Lists &amp; Spreadsheet</em> page.  Give the first column a title of, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{iterations}\text{.}\)</span>  Now generate the sequence of compositions as shown below by entering <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in the first open cell.  In cell A2, enter <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{=f(a1)}\)</span> just as you would in Excel.  You will see an algebraic result appear.  Now move your cursor to the bottom right corner of the cell until you see a <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{+}\)</span> appear and click and drag down the column to perform a “fill down”.  You should see expressions appear (see below).</div> <div class="para"><div class="image-box" style="width: 90%; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;"><img src="external/images/evaluate-sam-screens-11.png" class="contained" alt="11th set of screenshots"></div></div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h5>
