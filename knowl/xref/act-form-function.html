<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">This activity explores basic concepts of algebra including properties of algebraic structure.  In high school, the primary operations used in algebra were multiplication and addition.  Are these the only types of operations that can be used?  We will explore this question and look for patterns that are common across algebra.</div>
<div class="para">Recall that in your experiences in elementary school, you first learned to operate on the set of integers, <span class="process-math">\(\left\{\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \right\}\text{,}\)</span> using a simple operation, addition.  When this set was combined with the operation of addition, certain properties held.  Some of these properties included: <em class="emphasis">closure</em>, <em class="emphasis">associativity</em>, the existence of an <em class="emphasis">identity</em> element, and <em class="emphasis">inverses</em>.</div>
<div class="para">Consider the set of functions, <span class="process-math">\(T=\left\{e, f, g, h, j, k\right\}\text{,}\)</span> where the functions are defined as follows:</div>
<div class="para logical"><div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
e\left(x\right)=x, f\left(x\right)=\frac{1}{x}, g\left(x\right)=\frac{x}{1-x}, h\left(x\right)=1-x, 
j\left(x\right)=\frac{1}{1-x}, k\left(x\right)=\frac{x-1}{x}
\end{equation*}
</div></div>
<div class="para">Mathematics can be described as the study of patterns.  For this reason, we often look for similar structure in both nature and mathematical systems.  Mathematics can certainly be used to study patterns in the physical world, but we can also look for patterns within mathematics itself.  Are there times when one mathematical system is, for all practical purposes, “identical” to another mathematical system and therefore governed by the same properties and relationships?  If this is so, then one system can give us quite a bit of information about another system.  In fact, if one system is easier to operate on, we can use it instead and then deduce information about the other system without having to do more difficult computations.</div>
<div class="para">In this activity, we will explore what properties exist when pairing the set <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> above with the operation of composition of functions, <span class="process-math">\(\left(T,\circ \right)\text{.}\)</span>  As you explore this set, try to keep your eyes open for patterns in the relationships among functions.  Some properties you may want to check might include: closure, associativity, identity, inverses, and commutativity. For example, consider your experience with basic arithmetic.  For addition on the set of integers, the set is closed since adding two integers always results in another integer.  The number 0 acts as an identity (i.e. <span class="process-math">\(a+0=0+a=a\text{,}\)</span> leaving other elements unchanged) and 5 and -5 are inverses of each other (i.e. <span class="process-math">\(5+^{-}5=0\text{,}\)</span> where combining them yields 0, the identity).  This type of structure is very important for deducing mathematical truths within a mathematical system.</div>
<div class="para">To begin, we define the functions above on your computer algebra system.  This has already been done for you on page 1.1 of the TI-Nspire CAS document.  Once the functions are defined, build an operation table (called a Cayley table) for the composition of functions of the form <span class="process-math">\(A \circ B\)</span> in the space below by simply entering compositions such as <span class="process-math">\(f\left(g\left(x\right)\right)=\frac{x-1}{x}=k\left(x\right)\)</span> and recording the result in the table as shown.  This can be done more efficiently by first entering the functions in a spreadsheet (see page 1.2 of the <em class="emphasis">FormFunction.tns</em> file) and naming the entire set of functions “funset” and then performing compositions on the entire set all at once either on the <em class="emphasis">Calculator</em> page or in the <em class="emphasis">Lists &amp; Spreadsheets</em> page (see <a href="sec43-inverses-undoing-structure.html#fig-compose-functions-cas" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-compose-functions-cas.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 4.3.4">Figure 4.3.4</a>).  If you use the spreadsheet, note that the columns in the spreadsheet correspond to rows in the table you are filling in due to the way the same operation is performed for an entire column in the spreadsheet. This syntax is similar to Microsoft Excel [i.e. by typing <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{=f(funset)}\)</span>].</div>

How many different permutations of these functions would you need to check to be certain of associativity? Devise a plan to check associativity.  Your plan might include other groups from the class (divide and conquer is often very effective).</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>

<div class="para">Recall if a set along with an operation meets the four criteria of closure, associativity, an identity element, and all elements have inverses, then we call the set a <em class="emphasis">group</em>.

<div class="para">In general, do the elements of the set commute with each other?  In other words, do you <em class="emphasis">always</em> get the same result when combining any two given elements in either order (<em class="emphasis">commutativity</em>)? If all of the elements of a group commute with each other, then the group is called <em class="emphasis">abelian</em>. If a group is abelian, what kind of symmetry would you see in its Cayley table?</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(g)</span></h5>
<div class="para">If the group is <em class="emphasis">not abelian</em>, for each element of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{,}\)</span> find all elements of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> that do commute with it.

<div class="para">On page 2.2, use your algebraic spreadsheet to generate a sequence of <span class="process-math">\(k, k^2, k^3, \ldots, k^{10}\text{.}\)</span>  To do this, you can use the <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{Fill Down}\)</span> feature of the spreadsheet by first entering <span class="process-math">\(k\left(x\right)\)</span> in the cell <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{a1}\)</span> and then in cell <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{a2}\)</span> entering <span class="process-math">\(=k\left(a1\right)\text{.}\)</span>  Then select cell <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{a2}\)</span> and choose <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">menu</code> <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{3:Data}\)</span> followed by <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{3:Fill}\text{.}\)</span>  Using the down arrow key, move down in the spreadsheet about 8 cells or so and press <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">enter</code>· (See screens below for setting up the recursive composition).
