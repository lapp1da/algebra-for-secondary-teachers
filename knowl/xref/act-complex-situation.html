</h4>
<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">At the end of the classroom exchange from Jan’s lesson, Ken asked the very understandable question, "But where did Euler get this thing?  How did he figure out that <span class="process-math">\(e^{i\theta}=\cos\theta +i\sin\theta\text{?}\)</span>".  However, Jan’s response of, "Well you’ll just have to take my word for it right now.  Euler used mathematics that you can’t understand yet." may not be entirely accurate.  In this activity we explore how the use of Taylor polynomials can help Ken explore a surprising connection between trigonometry and the complex number systems.  During the next activity, we will want to use the interactive sketch found in <a href="sec22-complex-numbers.html#fig-complex-situation-plane" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-complex-situation-plane.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 2.2.7">Figure 2.2.7</a> below.</div>

</div> <div class="para">At this point, you may have noticed similarities among the three polynomial expansions that imitate the three transcendental functions: <span class="process-math">\(e^x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\sin\left(x\right)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\cos\left(x\right)\text{.}\)</span>  Describe any connections you see among the terms for these polynomial expansions.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Using the first six terms for each of the polynomial expansions of <span class="process-math">\(\cos\left(\theta\right)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sin\left(\theta\right)\text{,}\)</span> write out an expression for the approximation to <span class="process-math">\(\cos\left(\theta\right)+i\cdot\sin\left(\theta\right)\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">Now using the substitution of <span class="process-math">\(x=i\cdot\theta\)</span> in the polynomial expansion <span class="process-math">\(e^x=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}+\frac{x^6}{6!}+\cdots\text{,}\)</span> write out the first twelve terms.

As in the case of the relationship between rectangular and polar coordinates, we can also think of the same point defined by the rectangular form <span class="process-math">\(a+bi\)</span> as also defined by an angle and a radius.  For example, we can take the complex number <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\)</span> and express it as the point in the complex plane located at a distance of 1 from the origin and at an angle of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\pi}{3}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i=\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)+i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)\text{.}\)</span> Although these are both helpful ways to represent complex numbers, is there another way that is even simpler?</div> <div class="para">Now considering the fact that we can express any complex number <span class="process-math">\(a+bi\)</span> in the polar form, <span class="process-math">\(r\left(\cos\left(\theta\right)+i\cdot\sin\left(\theta\right)\right)\)</span> as you observed in part (c), what is the practical significance of your discovery?
