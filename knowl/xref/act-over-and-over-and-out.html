<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">Jill’s <em class="emphasis">Algebra I</em> class has been working with radicals and as a result of using her calculator, a student, Kay, raises a question during class.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Jill</em> : How did the homework go last night?  Does anyone have any questions about reducing the radical expressions?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Kay</em> : Well, I don’t really have a question about reducing the radicals, but I did have another question that’s kind of related to what we’re doing.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Jill</em> : OK, go for it.  What’ya got?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Kay</em> : Well, as I was working on some of the radical simplifying stuff, I was checking them by using my calculator to see if my answer matched when I punched the original expression on the calculator.  Anyway, I got to playing with my calculator during my advising period and noticed that when I entered something like <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> and kept hitting the equals button, it ended up giving me 1.  I tried it with <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{3}\)</span> and it did the same thing.  Will that always happen?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Jill</em> : Interesting.  Maybe we should take some time to try this.  <em class="emphasis">(To the class)</em> What I want you to do is get in your groups and see if you can find any numbers that when you take the square root over and over again do not end up at 1.</div>
<div class="para">[<em class="emphasis">Jill allows the students to look for a counter example for about 10 minutes and then brings the class back together for discussion.</em>]</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Jill</em> : Well, what did you find?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Jeff</em> : Our group couldn’t find any number that didn’t end up at 1.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Anna</em> : Neither could ours.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Sean</em> : At first our group thought we had found an example where it just kept getting bigger and bigger, but that was because I was using the <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> button instead of the square root.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Jill</em> : That raises an interesting question though, Sean.  Does the type of operation make a difference in whether or not it converges to a certain number?  The word <em class="emphasis">converge</em> just means that it gets closer and closer to that number as you keep repeating it.  Yes, Erin.  Do you want to say something?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Erin</em> : Well, I have a graphing calculator and I was trying to find an easier way to enter this stuff in it to do the repeat.  I used the [ANS] key.  What it does is take the last thing you got out of your calculator and does a new thing to it.  So what I did was put the <em class="emphasis">square root of x</em> in my <em class="emphasis">Y=</em> list and then entered <span class="process-math">\(Y_1\left(3\right)\)</span> on my screen and got 1.73 something. Then I just put in <span class="process-math">\(Y_1\left(ANS\right)\)</span> and kept hitting [ENTER].  This gave me the numbers that got closer and closer to 1.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Jill</em> : That’s a great idea.  It also now makes it easier to try other types of functions like Sean’s <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> example.  Let’s go through what Erin was talking about together on our class set of graphing calculators.  Take out your calculators and look up front.</div>
<div class="para">[<em class="emphasis">Jill takes about 5 minutes to go through the mechanics of how to evaluate an iterated function on the graphing calculator and then sent the groups exploring different functions.  She allowed them approximately 20 minutes to get started before the bell rang.  She assigned them the task of exploring this for homework and told the class that they would continue with the discussion the next day.</em>]</div>
<div class="para">The Next Day</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Jill</em> : Does anyone have anything to share from your exploring last night?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Jan</em> : I thought I’d try some other types of roots and so I tried <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt[3]{x}\)</span> and it went to 1 too.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Jill</em> : Did it go to 1 no matter what number you started with?</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Jan</em> : Yeah.  For everything I tried.  So I think that anything with roots will go to 1.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Sam</em> : I thought that too, but I tried something a little different.  I did the same thing Jan did with <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt[3]{x}\text{,}\)</span> but then I tried it by putting a 2 in front and used <span class="process-math">\(2\sqrt[3]{x}\text{.}\)</span> This time it didn’t go to 1, but went to 2.828 something.  So, it looks like it can go to things other than 1.  Can we make up a function that will go to any number we want?</div>
