<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">This activity explores basic concepts of algebra and calculus involved in using power series to imitate transcendental functions.  In particular, the series for <span class="process-math">\(\sin\left(x\right)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\cos\left(x\right)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(e^x\)</span> are investigated and connections are made with practical uses of such functions for creating computing algorithms used by calculators and computers to evaluate numerical approximations.</div>
<div class="para">Have you ever wondered how your calculator knows what the <span class="process-math">\(\ln\left(5\right)\)</span> or the <span class="process-math">\(\sin\left(0.7\right)\)</span> is or how it can find decimals for numbers like <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{3}\text{?}\)</span>  Did someone program every possible square root, trig value, or logarithm into the machine?  Wouldn’t that take up a tremendous amount of memory?  Well, the answer is that your calculator knows how to use basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to approximate these types of values to the desired decimal accuracy.  In this exploration you will first investigate how we can approximate more complicated transcendental functions using simple polynomials.  Once we establish this method for approximating functions with polynomials, we will then use it to explore a surprising connection between trigonometry and the complex number systems.</div>
<div class="para">To this point we have seen that if we zoom in far enough, a function looks a great deal like a straight line.  But how does this help us impersonate more complicated functions like <span class="process-math">\(e^x\text{?}\)</span>
</div>

<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Graph <span class="process-math">\(y=e^x\)</span> along with several possible linear functions that would look like the “linear-looking” graph of <span class="process-math">\(y=e^x\)</span> when you zoom in near <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span>  Remember, you need the linear function to have the same slope as <span class="process-math">\(y=e^x\)</span> and also have the same point in common with <span class="process-math">\(y=e^x\)</span> at zero.  Record the lines you tried along with brief explanations for why you tried those particular lines.  Give your final line that you feel best imitates <span class="process-math">\(y=e^x\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span>
</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Now that you have created a line that looks similar to <span class="process-math">\(y=e^x\)</span> near <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{,}\)</span> graph it along with <span class="process-math">\(y=e^x\)</span> on the same window.  Zoom out and give an approximation of the interval about <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> where your line is a “fairly close” imitation of <span class="process-math">\(y=e^x\text{.}\)</span>
</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Suppose you want to imitate <span class="process-math">\(y=e^x\)</span> within a larger interval.  Since <span class="process-math">\(y=e^x\)</span> is not linear, we need a function that curves so that it will “hug” the graph of <span class="process-math">\(y=e^x\)</span> through a larger interval.  Since quadratics are curved, experiment with your linear function from part (a) by adding on a term of the form <span class="process-math">\(ax^2\text{.}\)</span>  Record your choices for <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> along with sketches of your new quadratic function and <span class="process-math">\(y=e^x\)</span> on the same axes.  Give your final choice of quadratic function of the form <span class="process-math">\(ax^2+bx+c\)</span> that best imitates <span class="process-math">\(y=e^x\)</span> near <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span>
</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
<div class="para">You have now been able to extend the size of the interval where <span class="process-math">\(y=e^x\)</span> can be imitated by a polynomial by adding on a higher degree polynomial term.  Can this continue?  Take the quadratic function you have developed in part (c) and try to extend the interval of imitation further by adding on a third-degree term and experimenting with its coefficient. Give your final choice of cubic function of the form <span class="process-math">\(ax^3+bx^2+cx+d\)</span> that best imitates <span class="process-math">\(y=e^x\)</span> near <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> and sketch your graph of <span class="process-math">\(y=e^x\)</span> along with your cubic.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h5>
<div class="para">The polynomials you have created to imitate the function <span class="process-math">\(y=e^x\)</span> are called Taylor polynomials named for the mathematician, Brook Taylor.  To understand why these particular coefficients work for imitating this function (as Jeff in vignette was asking), let’s look at one other function (<span class="process-math">\(f\left(x\right)=\sin\left(x\right)\)</span>) and imitate it using a built-in command on your CAS. On most CAS, the <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{Taylor}\)</span> command has similar syntax.  On Maple, we use <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{taylorpoly(sin(x), x=0, 7)}\text{;}\)</span> to get a seventh degree polynomial that mimics <span class="process-math">\(f\left(x\right)=\sin\left(x\right)\)</span> near zero.  On a TI-Nspire CX CAS, the syntax is <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{taylor(sin(x), x, 7, 0)}\)</span> where the 0 at the end is the point near where you want to imitate the function and the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is the variable you would like used in the polynomial (if you omit the value about which you want to imitate the function, it assumes a value of 0).  On the TI-Nspire CX CAS you can find the <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{Taylor}\)</span> command under the <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{Series}\)</span> submenu of the <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{Calculus}\)</span> menu.</div> <div class="para">Use your CAS’s Taylor command to generate 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th degree Taylor polynomials for <span class="process-math">\(f\left(x\right)=\sin\left(x\right)\)</span> and record them in a table like the one in <a href="sec22-complex-numbers.html#fig-taylor-poly-table" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-taylor-poly-table.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 2.2.4">Figure 2.2.4</a>.

<div class="para">Now in order to understand why these particular polynomials work, let’s examine the 9th degree polynomial that you have found.  As you learned in Calculus 1, we can infer information about the “shape” of a graph by looking at the derivative.  More specific, the first derivative tells us the slope of the function at a given point, the second derivative tells us the rate at which the slope is changing, the third derivative tells us the rate at which the rate of the slope is changing and so on.  With each higher order derivative, we gain more information about the “shape” of the graph and its behavior.  This is the idea behind Taylor polynomials.</div> <div class="para">To explore this relationship, complete the following table where you evaluate the <span class="process-math">\(n^{th}\)</span> derivatives of both your polynomial and <span class="process-math">\(f\left(x\right)=\sin\left(x\right)\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span> Record them in a table like the one in <a href="sec22-complex-numbers.html#fig-taylor-poly-derivatives-sin-table" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-taylor-poly-derivatives-sin-table.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 2.2.5">Figure 2.2.5</a> and state your observations related to your results.</div> <div class="para"><figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 90%; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%;"><img src="external/images/taylor-poly-derivatives-sin-table.png" class="contained"></div>

<div class="para">The fact that we can create polynomials to imitate the functions <span class="process-math">\(e^x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\sin\left(x\right)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\cos\left(x\right)\)</span> is extremely important from a practical sense.  Have you ever wondered how your calculator knows the value of something like <span class="process-math">\(\sin\left(0.7\right)\text{?}\)</span>  The operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are basic algorithms that exist as routines in any computer or calculator (note that exponents can be accomplished using repeated multiplication).  If we wish to know <span class="process-math">\(\sin\left(0.7\right)\text{,}\)</span> the machine can simply create a finite polynomial that imitates the sine function to the desired decimal accuracy and then compute it using these basic binary operations that make up the polynomial.</div> <div class="para">Now suppose you have only a non-scientific calculator (without sine, cosine, and tangent keys) and need to evaluate <span class="process-math">\(\sin\left(1.78\right)\)</span> where the argument for sine is in radians.
