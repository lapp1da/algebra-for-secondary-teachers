<div class="introduction"><div class="para">Take a square piece of paper and fold it along one edge into thirds (fold it like a formal letter that you are putting into an envelope).  Now unfold the square and using the side adjacent to the side you just used to fold it into thirds, fold it in half and then fold it into half again (essentially folding into fourths).</div></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Highlight along the "thirds" edge, two of the three segments along that direction (this represents 2/3 of the unit length).</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<div class="para">In a similar manner, highlight along the "fourths" edge, three of the four segments along that direction (this represents 3/4 of the unit length).</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Shade the entire rectangle formed by the two edges that you have just shaded.  What does this area represent?</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
<div class="para">How many small rectanlges have you shaded?  Where does this number come from with respect to the two fractions that they represent (2/3 and 3/4)?</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h5>

<div class="para">If you were to express the fraction of small shaded rectangles as compared to the total number of small rectangles in the square, how would you state it?</div> <div class="para">There are ____________________ out of ____________________ small rectangles that are shaded.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(g)</span></h5>
