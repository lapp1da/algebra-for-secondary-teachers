<section class="introduction" id="sec12-ccss-overview-2"><div class="para" id="sec12-ccss-overview-2-1">The <em class="emphasis">Common Core State Standards for Mathematics</em> (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010) are broken into two areas. When most people think of mathematics standards, the first things that come to mind are usually standards related to what mathematics will be taught.

<div class="para" id="subsec-content-standards-2">The Content Standards are broken down by grade level for the K-8 grades, but then are arranged by content areas once we get to high school.  The standards are organized into domains that progress over several grades so that it is easier to see learning trajectories and expectations as students move through the curriculum.  For each grade in the K-8 band, the grade begins with generally 2 to 4 focal points to show the broader goals for that particular grade.  Since at the high school level, students in various grades may be taking different mathematics classes than their counterparts, standards are presented by conceptual theme (<em class="emphasis">Number and Quantity</em>, <em class="emphasis">Algebra</em>, <em class="emphasis">Functions</em>, <em class="emphasis">Modeling</em>, <em class="emphasis">Geometry</em>, <em class="emphasis">Statistics and Probability</em>).</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-content-standards-3">The Content Standards are more specific and define what students should understand and be able to do and thus are the most refined categorization.  Since many of these standards are linked, the standards are then organized into <em class="emphasis">Clusters</em> which are groups of related standards.  <em class="emphasis">Domains</em> are then larger groups that progress across grades (see <a href="sec12-ccss-overview.html#fig-ccss-organization" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-ccss-organization.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 1.2.1">Figure 1.2.1</a>).</div>

<div class="para" id="subsec-content-standards-7">You will notice in the Grade 5 Overview, <em class="emphasis">Operations and Algebraic Thinking</em> appear first.  For many people, "algebra" means manipulating letters and symbols, but the CCSS have algebraic thinking as a goal beginning in kindergarten.  Algebra is far more than the maipulating of symbols and the movement toward abstraction begins early.  Algebraic thinking involves noticing, expressing, and analyzing patterns and these are activities where young learners excel until our curriculum often suppresses it by focusing on memorization and procedural fluency.  We will discuss the nature of algebra in greater detail later in the text, but for now, it is important to realize that the foundation for what we want students to be able to understand later in formal algebra courses begins with patterning.  For an interesting read on how algebra develops in young learners, consider, <em class="emphasis">Algebra in the Early Grades</em> by Kaput, Carraher, and Blanton (2008).</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-content-standards-8">As the CCSS get to Grade 8, there is a more deliberate move toward symbolization.  Here the expectations include things like  "Analyze and solve linear equations and pairs of simultaneous linear equations", "Define, evaluate, and compare functions", and "Use functions to model relationships between quantities". This does not mean that symbolic forms are not expected in the earlier grades, but rather that in Grade 8, formalization of these concepts should be a focus of the curriculum.  For this reason, the CCSS also provides a summary of <em class="emphasis">focal points</em> at the beginning of each grade level (K-8).  An example of this can be seen in <a href="sec12-ccss-overview.html#fig-ccss-grade8-focal-points" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-ccss-grade8-focal-points.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 1.2.3">Figure 1.2.3</a>.</div>

<div class="para" id="subsec-ccss-mathematical-practice-2">While the mathematical content of what should be taught at various grade levels is often the major focus of the curriculum or standards, there is a much broader view that is equally important when it comes to developing mathematical thinking.  It is not enough to "know" content.  If we realize that mathematics is a creative endeavor, we must also address the <em class="emphasis">habits of mind</em> that need to be developed for mathematical thinking.  For this reason, the Common Core State Standards was intentionally partitioned into two parts in order to make this point clear.  In fact, when you read through the CCSS, you will notice that these habits or mind are actually listed first before the Content Standards are addressed.  This drives home the importance of these mental processes that are so essential for preparing students to be good mathematical thinkers (or overall critical thinkers for that matter).  We have described the Content Standards, but now we need to address the <em class="emphasis">Standards for Mathematical Practice</em> (see <a href="sec12-ccss-overview.html#fig-ccss-math-practices-list" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-ccss-math-practices-list.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 1.2.4">Figure 1.2.4</a>).  These standards describe the 8 basic habits of mind that we need students to possess in order to use the mathematics content knowledge effectively and creatively.

Such arguments can make sense and be correct, even though they are not generalized or made formal until later grades. Later, students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies.

As you drive along the highway, I am sure you have noticed deer carcasses in the ditch.  Deer collisions are a common cause of insurance claims and vehicles have evolved to try and reduce the number of deer incidents.  Some cars have sensors that alert the driver to a potential object in the road and can even engage the brakes.  So how does the technology make decisions on how to brake if an object is detected?  It is not practical to slam on the brakes if the object is still a fair distance away.  However, if the object is closer, the vehicle may need to decelerate more quickly.  How fast can a vehicle decelerate safely without harming the occupants?  These questions can be answered by a series of calculations that relate distance, rate, and time.  In this activity, you will explore a simple model for dealing with this question.  Consider the problem posed in the video below.</div>

<div class="para" id="act-roadkill-ccss-reflection-11-1-1">While this activity uses robotic Rovers to engage students in looking at relationships, you might be tempted to say, "But when I go to teach, I won’t likely have Rovers...How can I use this activity?

When I walk through a toy aisle of a store, I am always thinking, "How can I use that toy to teach math?".  To get you thinking, you have in front of you a toy car that can be pulled back to engage a spring so that it moves forward when released.  In your groups, devise a plan to teach some of the same mathematical concepts you identified in Roadkill using this cheap car.  Summarize your ideas on the whiteboards and be prepared to share with your colleagues.</div></article></article></div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-applying-ccss-6">The Commonn Core State Standards have been a topic of debate by partents and teachers alike.  Many parents become frustrated when they struggle to help their children with homework.  One example that made its way around the internet was a parent (who claims a degree in engineering) having difficulty helping with subtraction.  The curriclum has children use a number line to solve the problem by moving along the number line.  The parent expresses frustration since he thinks the children should just line up the digits and use the "standard" algorithm that he was taught (see for a summary).  One of the reasons for parental frustration is that many parents simply memorized or mimicked procedures without connecting it to the meaning of the algorithm and therefore the alternative methods being taught do not make sense to them.</div>

<div class="para" id="subsec-applying-ccss-8">What is interesting about the method explained in <a href="sec12-ccss-overview.html#fig-ccss-frustration" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-ccss-frustration.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 1.2.6">Figure 1.2.6</a> is that while angry parents complain about this "new" method, it is actually not "new" at all.  This is actually how my grandmother learned it.  This method called "counting on" or "cashier’s subtraction" stems from an era where electronic cash registers did not exist and cashiers actually "counted back" a patron’s change.  In fact, from a practical sense, people with an understanding of arithmetic do not usually line up digits and subtract.  Counting on is a much easier way to <em class="emphasis">mentally</em> compute a difference.  Otherwise, people generally pull out their phone and use their calculator app.  I once received free frozen yogurt because a cashier could not make change.  His cash register locked up and he could not rely on it to tell him how much change to give me.  I tried to walk him through counting on, but instead, he simply gave my wife and me free frozen yogurt and locked the door behind us as we left, closing up for the night.</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-applying-ccss-9">As we work through this course, it is essential that the preservice teacher try to make sense of the Common Core State Standards and always ask the question, "Why do we teach this concept and how can I help students make sense of it?".  Reducing mimicking in favor of thinking is the key and as teachers we should always strive for thinking over mere procedural fluency.</div></section></section></div>
