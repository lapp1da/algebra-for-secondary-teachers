</h2>
<section class="introduction" id="sec22-complex-numbers-2"><div class="para logical" id="sec22-complex-numbers-2-1">
<div class="para">Throughout history, our number system has evolved primarily driven by necessity.  It should come as no surprise that our current system (the complex numbers) was also driven by an issue with the real number system.  On of the motivators was the search for real solutions to equations, in particular, polynomial equations.  The solution to the general quadratic equation, <span class="process-math">\(ax^2+bx+c=0\text{,}\)</span> had beeen established as</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">but there was still some concern for the situation when a negative appeared under the radical.  Putting these negative square roots aside, the usefulness of the real solutions found with the quadratic formula was considered a leap forward.</div>
</div>
<div class="para" id="sec22-complex-numbers-2-2">In 1494, Luca Picioli published is volume, <em class="emphasis">Summa de Arithmetica</em>, where he examined linear and quadratic equations.  However, there was still a search for a solution to the general cubic, <span class="process-math">\(ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0\text{.}\)</span>  At the time, the solution to some forms of the cubic had been found.  For example, Scipione del Ferro had found a way to solve the "depressed" cubic (meaning one without the squared term) of the form, <span class="process-math">\(x^3+mx=n\text{,}\)</span> but the general cubic was still out of reach and Picioli did not have high hopes that a solution to the general cubic could be found.  In his work, Picioli began to experiment with more symbolic notation using the symbol, <em class="emphasis">co</em>, to denote a variable (here <em class="emphasis">co</em> was short for <em class="emphasis">cosa</em>, Italian for "thing" or "thing to be found"), and was a leap forward in compressing notation so that ideas could be expressed in a smaller visual space reducing the number of words used in formalizing mathematical arguments.  We will address the importance of compressed expressions with respect to Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno’s (2008) model for the development of symbolic meaning later, but for now, it suffices to say, mathematics was on the verge of significant advancement.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec22-complex-numbers-2-3">Scipione del Ferro had kept his discovery for finding a solution to <span class="process-math">\(x^3+mx=n\)</span> a secret as was often the practice of the time, since academic appointments were not very secure and mathematicians could be "dethroned" from their positions by being challenged.  Upon his death, he passed his solution to his student, Antonio Fior.  Now Fior was not nearly as good of a mathematician as del Ferro, but was a bit more brash. Fior began challenging mathematicians since he knew all he had to do was give them depressed cubics that only he alone knew how to solve and he would be the victor.  As fate would have it, Fior chose to challenge the Brescian scholar, Niccolo Fontana.  Now Fontana was a brilliant mathematician, but was disfigured by the sword of a French soldier as a child and his deformity caused him to speak with a stammer.  He was therefore more commonly known by the cruel epithet, Tartaglia (The Stammerer).  Well, Tartaglia began to attack Fior’s challenge of 30 depressed cubics, but had not made much progress.  As the time to submit his final solutions approached, on February 13, 1535, he had a breakthrough and discovered the solution to the depressed cubic, <span class="process-math">\(x^3+mx=n\text{,}\)</span> defeating his challenger.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec22-complex-numbers-2-4">Now that Tartaglia had mastered the depressed cubic, another brilliant mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano, sought an audience with Tartaglia in hopes of learning the solution to the depressed cubic.  Tartaglia refused to reveal his secret, but after many other attempts at persuasion, Tartaglia finally relented with the caveat that Cardano would not reveal or publish the solution.  Cardano gladly accepted the terms.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec22-complex-numbers-2-5">Enter the young 20-year-old mathematician, Ludovico Ferrari.  Ferrari approached Cardano asking for work and they soon forged a partnership.  With their collaboration, Cardano found a way to depress the general cubic, <span class="process-math">\(ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0\text{,}\)</span> into one of the form, <span class="process-math">\(x^3+mx=n\text{.}\)</span>  However, Cardano’s dilemma was that in order to publish his solution to the general cubic, he would then need to use Tartaglia’s solution for the depressed cubic and he had vowed not to reveal it.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec22-complex-numbers-2-6">Stymied by his moral dilemma, in 1543, Cardano and Ferrari went to Bologna to explore the works of del Ferro.  To their surprise, they found that del Ferro had actually written down his original solution to the depressed cubic, prior to Tartaglia discovering it.  Since he could now state that he got the solution to the depressed cubic from del Ferro and not Tartaglia, Cardano was now free to publish the solution to the general cubic.  When his work, <em class="emphasis">Ars Magna</em> was published, it was earth shattering news to the mathematical community.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec22-complex-numbers-2-7">So now you are wondering, how is this historical trip relevant to complex numbers?  As it turns out, using Cardano’s process for finding solutions to the general cubic, at stages of the process, the pesky number, <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{-1}\text{,}\)</span> shows up.  However, when continuing the process, we can have the <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span> resolved by squaring and thus obtain <em class="emphasis">real</em> solutions in the end.  So in order to obtain real solutions to the general cubic, mathematicians had to "tip-toe" through the imaginary, <span class="process-math">\(i=\sqrt{-1}\text{,}\)</span> and this was uncomfortable.  With the quadratic formula, we could just ignore the messy <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span> since those solutions weren’t real anyway, but here, we have to put up with <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span> to arrive at real solutions.  Mathematicians could no longer simply turn a blind eye, but had to face that such numbers must exist.</div></section><section class="subsection" id="subsec-complex-ccss"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<div class="para" id="subsec-complex-ccss-2">The secondary school curriculum includes the teaching of complex numbers even though some aspects of this are not required for all students graduating from high school.  Note that the Common Core State Standards denote this with a (+) symbol next to those topics not expected for all students.  However, all secondary teachers must be expected to teach these concepts and certainly any student planning to enter scientific fields should be expected to leave high school having exerpience with complex numbers.

<div class="para" id="subsec-complex-ccss-4">One of the important skills as a teacher is the ability to take specific curriculum and modify or add to it to make connections for your students.  In this section, we will spend some time examining the structure of a specific set of curriculum materials and reflect on how you might make classroom decisions to take advantage of connected mathematics content in light of your own understanding of the mathematics you learned as an undergraduate.  In this case we will use the secondary curriculum <em class="emphasis">Contemporary Mathematics in Context: A Unified Approach (Core-Plus)</em> as a springboard for discussion.</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-complex-ccss-5">“When will I ever teach this?”  You most likely have uttered this statement while taking undergraduate mathematics courses as part of your teacher preparation program.  The purpose of this section is to highlight examples of where the secondary mathematics curriculum and the undergraduate mathematics curriculum are inextricably connected.  To begin this discussion, we may want to brush up on some mathematical ideas on which a teacher tasked with teaching complex numbers may rely.  The Core-Plus curriculum is counting on connections and is designed to take advantage of a variety of mathematical concepts as the complex number system is explored.</div>

<div class="para" id="act-impersonating-functions-2-1">This activity explores basic concepts of algebra and calculus involved in using power series to imitate transcendental functions.

Wouldn’t that take up a tremendous amount of memory?  Well, the answer is that your calculator knows how to use basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to approximate these types of values to the desired decimal accuracy.  In this exploration you will first investigate how we can approximate more complicated transcendental functions using simple polynomials.  Once we establish this method for approximating functions with polynomials, we will then use it to explore a surprising connection between trigonometry and the complex number systems.</div>

<div class="para" id="subsec-complex-ccss-10">Many who begin a teacher preparation program often have a misconception that since they have experienced mathematical content as a learner, teaching it simply consists of telling students what you have already learned yourself.  As I was preparing to be a teacher, this was also my naïve position.  When I first started to prepare lessons and act them out with my peers, I soon realized that I had not really internalized the mathematics deeply enough to respond to interesting questions posed by my fellow pre-service teachers.  But I would just dismiss it at first by justifying it as, "these are my peers, so that’s not such a big deal.  I am going to teach high school students, not my peers who were already in undergraduate courses with me".  However, observing both in field placements and videos of actual classrooms, I saw high school students asking really interesting questions for which I had no reasonable response. In my field placements, typically the teacher would skirt the issue and tell the student to just follow the steps they had been shown leaving the students frustrated.</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-complex-ccss-11">As time went on, I began to realize that the reason the teacher avoided these questions was because, like me, they did not fully grasp the mathematics that they were teaching.  This expereince motivated me to try to do more than memorize the procedures I was being taught, but rather to connect ideas.  This actually helped me to reduce what I needed to commit to memory since I could retrieve information better once it was connected to other concepts.  For this reason, we should now reflect on our mathematical experience and connect it to your earlier responses to Jeff’s question in the classroom scenario.</div>
