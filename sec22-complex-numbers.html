<section class="introduction" id="sec22-complex-numbers-2"><div class="para logical" id="sec22-complex-numbers-2-1">
<div class="para">Throughout history, our number system has evolved primarily driven by necessity.  It should come as no surprise that our current system (the complex numbers) was also driven by an issue with the real number system.  One of the motivators was the search for real solutions to equations, in particular, polynomial equations.  The solution to the general quadratic equation, <span class="process-math">\(ax^2+bx+c=0\text{,}\)</span> had beeen established as</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">but there was still some concern for the situation when a negative appeared under the radical.  Putting these negative square roots aside, the usefulness of the real solutions found with the quadratic formula was considered a leap forward.</div>
</div>
<div class="para" id="sec22-complex-numbers-2-2">In 1494, Luca Picioli published his volume, <em class="emphasis">Summa de Arithmetica</em>, where he examined linear and quadratic equations.  However, there was still a search for a solution to the general cubic, <span class="process-math">\(ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0\text{.}\)</span>  At the time, the solution to some forms of the cubic had been found.  For example, Scipione del Ferro had found a way to solve the "depressed" cubic (meaning one without the squared term) of the form, <span class="process-math">\(x^3+mx=n\text{,}\)</span> but the general cubic was still out of reach and Picioli did not have high hopes that a solution to the general cubic could be found.  In his work, Picioli began to experiment with more symbolic notation using the symbol, <em class="emphasis">co</em>, to denote a variable (here <em class="emphasis">co</em> was short for <em class="emphasis">cosa</em>, Italian for "thing" or "thing to be found"), and was a leap forward in compressing notation so that ideas could be expressed in a smaller visual space reducing the number of words used in formalizing mathematical arguments.  We will address the importance of compressed expressions with respect to Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno’s (2008) model for the development of symbolic meaning later, but for now, it suffices to say, mathematics was on the verge of significant advancement.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec22-complex-numbers-2-3">Scipione del Ferro had kept his discovery for finding a solution to <span class="process-math">\(x^3+mx=n\)</span> a secret as was often the practice of the time, since academic appointments were not very secure and mathematicians could be "dethroned" from their positions by being challenged.  Upon his death, he passed his solution to his student, Antonio Fior.  Now Fior was not nearly as good of a mathematician as del Ferro, but was a bit more brash. Fior began challenging mathematicians since he knew all he had to do was give them depressed cubics that only he alone knew how to solve and he would be the victor.  As fate would have it, Fior chose to challenge the Brescian scholar, Niccolo Fontana.  Now Fontana was a brilliant mathematician, but was disfigured by the sword of a French soldier as a child and his deformity caused him to speak with a stammer.  He was therefore more commonly known by the cruel epithet, Tartaglia (The Stammerer).  Well, Tartaglia began to attack Fior’s challenge of 30 depressed cubics, but had not made much progress.  As the time to submit his final solutions approached, on February 13, 1535, he had a breakthrough and discovered the solution to the depressed cubic, <span class="process-math">\(x^3+mx=n\text{,}\)</span> defeating his challenger.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec22-complex-numbers-2-4">Now that Tartaglia had mastered the depressed cubic, another brilliant mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano, sought an audience with Tartaglia in hopes of learning the solution to the depressed cubic.  Tartaglia refused to reveal his secret, but after many other attempts at persuasion, Tartaglia finally relented with the caveat that Cardano would not reveal or publish the solution.  Cardano gladly accepted the terms.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec22-complex-numbers-2-5">Enter the young 20-year-old mathematician, Ludovico Ferrari.  Ferrari approached Cardano asking for work and they soon forged a partnership.  With their collaboration, Cardano found a way to depress the general cubic, <span class="process-math">\(ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0\text{,}\)</span> into one of the form, <span class="process-math">\(x^3+mx=n\text{.}\)</span>  However, Cardano’s dilemma was that in order to publish his solution to the general cubic, he would then need to use Tartaglia’s solution for the depressed cubic and he had vowed not to reveal it.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec22-complex-numbers-2-6">Stymied by his moral dilemma, in 1543, Cardano and Ferrari went to Bologna to explore the works of del Ferro.  To their surprise, they found that del Ferro had actually written down his original solution to the depressed cubic, prior to Tartaglia discovering it.  Since he could now state that he got the solution to the depressed cubic from del Ferro and not Tartaglia, Cardano was now free to publish the solution to the general cubic.  When his work, <em class="emphasis">Ars Magna</em> was published, it was earth shattering news to the mathematical community.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec22-complex-numbers-2-7">So now you are wondering, how is this historical trip relevant to complex numbers?  As it turns out, using Cardano’s process for finding solutions to the general cubic, at stages of the process, the pesky number, <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{-1}\text{,}\)</span> shows up.  However, when continuing the process, we can have the <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span> resolved by squaring and thus obtain <em class="emphasis">real</em> solutions in the end.  So in order to obtain real solutions to the general cubic, mathematicians had to "tip-toe" through the imaginary, <span class="process-math">\(i=\sqrt{-1}\text{,}\)</span> and this was uncomfortable.  With the quadratic formula, we could just ignore the messy <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span> since those solutions weren’t real anyway, but here, we have to put up with <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span> to arrive at real solutions.  Mathematicians could no longer simply turn a blind eye, but had to face that such numbers must exist.</div></section><section class="subsection" id="subsec-complex-ccss"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<div class="para" id="subsec-prelim-complex-connections-6">Many who begin a teacher preparation program often have a misconception that since they have experienced mathematical content as a learner, teaching it simply consists of telling students what you have already learned yourself.  As I was preparing to be a teacher, this was also my naïve position.  When I first started to prepare lessons and act them out with my peers, I soon realized that I had not really internalized the mathematics deeply enough to respond to interesting questions posed by my fellow pre-service teachers.  But I would just dismiss it at first by justifying it as, "these are my peers, so that’s not such a big deal.  I am going to teach high school students, not my peers who were already in undergraduate courses with me".  However, observing both in field placements and videos of actual classrooms, I saw high school students asking really interesting questions for which I had no reasonable response. In my field placements, typically the teacher would skirt the issue and tell the student to just follow the steps they had been shown leaving the students frustrated.</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-prelim-complex-connections-7">As time went on, I began to realize that the reason the teacher avoided these questions was because, like me, they did not fully grasp the mathematics that they were teaching.  This expereince motivated me to try to do more than memorize the procedures I was being taught, but rather to connect ideas.  This actually helped me to reduce what I needed to commit to memory since I could retrieve information better once it was connected to other concepts.  For this reason, we should now reflect on our mathematical experience and connect it to your earlier responses to Jeff’s question in the classroom scenario.</div>

<section class="introduction" id="subsec-pulling-together-geometry-2"><div class="para" id="subsec-pulling-together-geometry-2-1">Just as the Greeks were wary of numbers such as  <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\text{,}\)</span> mathematicians were also cautious when it came to the solutions of equations like  <span class="process-math">\(x^2=-1\text{.}\)</span>  It did not seem conceivable to have a number that when multiplied by itself could yield a negative number.  In fact, negative numbers themselves were still suspect and even though Euler had shown that the product of two negatives was a positive (see <a href="sec21-elementary-concepts-number.html#thm-product-two-negatives" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/thm-product-two-negatives.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Theorem 2.1.17: Euler’s Proof that the Product of Two Negatives Is Positive">Theorem 2.1.17</a>), mathematicians were not quite ready to deal with the interpretation of a negative number.  Nonetheless, as we noted before, when Cardano was able to come up with <em class="emphasis">real</em> solutions to the general cubic equation, <span class="process-math">\(ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0\text{,}\)</span> by tiptoeing through solutions to intermediate equations where <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{-1}\)</span> existed, interest grew in regard to this weird number, <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{-1}\text{.}\)</span>
</div></section><div class="para" id="subsec-pulling-together-geometry-3">Although the imaginary number <span class="process-math">\(i=\sqrt{-1}\)</span> has become accepted and used to extend the real numbers, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\text{,}\)</span> to the complex numbers, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}\text{,}\)</span> how do we as mathematicians come to understand this set?  Before we delve deeper into the ways in which the complex numbers help us connect various branches of mathematics, let us first have a brief review of how complex numbers can be viewed and the representations associated with their understanding.</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-pulling-together-geometry-4">Summarizing what we have discussed thus far, you will recall that our numeration system has evolved from the basic counting numbers, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}^+\)</span> to the whole numbers, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}^+ \cup \left\{0\right\}\text{,}\)</span> to the integers, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}\text{,}\)</span> to the rational numbers, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\text{,}\)</span> and finally the real numbers, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\text{.}\)</span>  As we have seen, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}^+ \subset \mathbb{Z}^+ \cup \left\{0\right\} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset 
\mathbb{R} \text{.}\)</span>  So how do the complex numbers fit into this scheme?  We would like to have an extension of our real numbers so that <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Z}^+ \subset \mathbb{Z}^+ \cup \left\{0\right\} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset 
\mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C}\text{.}\)</span>  In order to extend the real numbers, if we allow the imaginary numbers to simply augment the real numbers by adding on an imaginary part to a real number such as <span class="process-math">\(a+bi\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are real numbers, then we can reduce the complex numbers to real numbers by simply using the special case where <span class="process-math">\(b=0\)</span> to generate the real numbers.  Therefore we obtain the following definition.</div>

</div></article></div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-pulling-together-geometry-6">Now that we have a definition, how do we make sense of these numbers?  Until the complex numbers came along, all was fine.  We could think of the whole numbers as the cardinality of sets of objects.  When negative numbers came on the scene, we could understand them through a process of “taking away” from sets of objects.  As we progressed to rational and irrational numbers, we invoked a measurement model (the number line) to describe all of the previous types of numbers.  But how then do we interpret complex numbers?</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-pulling-together-geometry-7">If we take a closer look at the various parts of a complex number, we can gain some insight into how to represent them.  Since a complex number, <span class="process-math">\(a+bi\text{,}\)</span> is made up of “coefficients” <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> that are real numbers, why not use the model that has worked for real numbers, the number line?  The only problem is that we now have two real numbers associated with a given complex number.  So which one do we use?  The solution is to use both.  Why not think of a complex number as an ordered pair of real numbers. This would imply that we can plot a complex number in a coordinate plane using <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{1}\)</span> as the <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{real}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{unit}\)</span> along one axis and <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{i}\)</span> as the <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{imaginary}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{unit}\)</span> along the other axis since <span class="process-math">\(a+bi=a\cdot 1+b\cdot i\text{.}\)</span> As a result, we can think of a complex number, <span class="process-math">\(a+bi\text{,}\)</span> as a point in the plane.</div>

<div class="para" id="subsec-pulling-together-geometry-9">One advantage to this representation is that when we consider the real numbers as a subset of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span> by setting <span class="process-math">\(b=0\text{,}\)</span> from a graphical perspective, the plane is reduced to the real line and thus we have a consistent representation for the real numbers using a measurement model.  In addition, from a linear algebra perspective, we can also view complex numbers as <em class="emphasis">vectors</em> and thus the vector space, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^2\text{,}\)</span> can be thought of as isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> as a <em class="emphasis">subspace</em> of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para" id="subsec-pulling-together-geometry-15">When we extend our number system representing them as points in a plane, concepts like absolute value become more interesting.  How do we interpret the concept of absolute value for complex numbers?  One of the beautiful things about mathematics is its logical consistency.  When it comes to absolute value, we should expect nothing less.  Recall that our concept of absolute value for real numbers is linked to a relationship of distance on the real number line.  For the real numbers, <span class="process-math">\(\left|x\right|\)</span> is just the distance of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> from 0 on the number line.  Why not adopt a similar concept for the absolute value of a complex number.  In this case, instead of the position of 0 on a line, we invoke the analogous point for a plane.  Therefore we define the absolute value or <em class="emphasis">modulus</em> of a complex number, <span class="process-math">\(z\text{,}\)</span> as the distance of <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> from the origin of the complex plane, denoted by <span class="process-math">\(\left|z\right|\text{.}\)</span>

<section class="introduction" id="subsec-orbits-complex-numbers-2"><div class="para" id="subsec-orbits-complex-numbers-2-1">Just like the real numbers, the complex numbers have a structure that allows for the solution of equations by using basic properties.  We will expand on these later when we address the concept of a <em class="emphasis">group</em> within the context of abstract algebra, but for now it suffices to say that just like the real numbers under multiplication, there exists an <em class="emphasis">identity element</em> that when multiplied by any number leaves it alone.  For example, consider <span class="process-math">\(5 \cdot 1=1 \cdot 5=5\text{.}\)</span>  Here the number 1 is acting as the identity element.  When it comes to solving equations, this is an important idea since if we can get the coefficient of a variable to be 1, we can basically ignore it.  Consider the equation, <span class="process-math">\(5x=15\text{.}\)</span>  If we can only find a way to make the coefficient of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> a 1, it for all practical purposes can be ignored the variable is then alone on one side of the equation leaving us able to simply read off the solution.  But how can we "make" the coefficient a 1?  We can’t just change it.  Well, the key is to exploit a relationship between an <em class="emphasis">identity element</em> and an <em class="emphasis">inverse element</em>.  Basically, an <em class="emphasis">inverse</em> is an element (or number in this case) that when combined with a number using the operation (multiplication in this case) yields the <em class="emphasis">identity</em>. In the case of our equation, <span class="process-math">\(5x=15\text{,}\)</span> we need a number that when multiplied by 5 gives 1.  The number, <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{5}\text{,}\)</span> works here as <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{5}\)</span> is the <em class="emphasis">multiplicative inverse</em> of <span class="process-math">\(5\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para logical" id="subsec-orbits-complex-numbers-2-2">
<div class="para">The use of this relationship between identities and inverses is the key to solving many problems including puzzles like Rubik’s Cube and thus permeates all of mathematics.  For our <span class="process-math">\(5x=15\)</span> example, we simply multiply by <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{5}\)</span> on the left on both sides of the equation and we get</div>

+i\sin \left(\frac{3\pi}{28}+\frac{2 \pi k}{7} \right) \right)\)</span> and graphing the x-coordinate as <span class="process-math">\(real\left(z\left(k\right)^t\right)\)</span> and y-coordinate as <span class="process-math">\(imag \left(z\left(k\right)^t\right)\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(k=\left \{0,1,2,3\right \}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t=\left \{0,1,2,\ldots, 7\right \}\text{.}\)</span>  They also use a connected line to show the progression from one power to the next.  The geometric representation for each value of <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> shows the rotation about the origin by the same angle for successive powers and an elongation of the modulus finally ending at the complex number, <span class="process-math">\(-2+2i\)</span> when raised to the 7th power.  Since the angle that is being used for the rotation is of the form <span class="process-math">\(\theta_r=\frac{3\pi}{28}+\frac{2 \pi k}{7}\text{,}\)</span> you will notice that as <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> increases, the size of the angle rotation between successive powers also increases.</div>
