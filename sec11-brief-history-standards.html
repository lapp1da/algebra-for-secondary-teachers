<section class="introduction" id="sec11-brief-history-standards-2"><div class="para" id="sec11-brief-history-standards-2-1">Although the <em class="emphasis">Principle and Standards for School Mathematics</em> (PSSM) (NCTM, 2000) and the <em class="emphasis">Common Core State Standards</em> (NGACBP and CCSSO, 2010) treat algebra as a standard for PreK-12, society tends to view algebra as a part of mathematics relegated to the secondary curriculum.  In fact, even mathematicians often fail to understand how algebra could be taught to a first grader.  Why is there such a misunderstanding between organizations such as NCTM and society?  Why is there such a misunderstanding between NCTM and the mathematics community?  Perhaps in order to understand why these differences in the perception of algebra exist, we must first look at the historical and traditional teaching of algebra in the United States.</div></section><div class="para" id="sec11-brief-history-standards-3">Much of why we see slow advancement of educational practice is that humans are often change-averse. For example, consider the "traditional" secondary curriculum consisting of the sequence of courses: Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, and PreCalculus.  Why are these courses in the sequence that they are? Doesn’t it seem odd that Geometry is sandwiched between Algebra 1 and 2?  Why are the subareas of mathematics separate at all?  As it turns out, tradition is the real reason we see approaches like integrated curricula (which have much support from research) mounting so much resistance.  The current sequence of Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, and PreCalculus actually dates back to 1894.  Let me say that again, <em class="emphasis">1894</em>! In 1894, the National Education Association (NEA) was dealing with the fact that very few students completed high school.  There was a desire to make sure as many students as possible had some exposure to both algebra and geometry before leaving school.  The solution — teach Algebra 1 followed immediately by Geometry. This means that the typical student would see both by the end of the sophomore year when they might leave formal education (Reys and Reys, 2009; NEA, 1894).  So to sum things up, the current system typically used for secondary mathematics curricula dates back to a time over 125 years ago where the motivation was the fact that very few students finished high school.  For this reason, as educators, we should always be asking ourselves why we do what we do?  We need to look at the research and ask if the assumptions we make are still valid assumptions.  The reasons, "Because that’s the way we’ve always done it" or "Because that’s the way I learned it" are not sufficient for rational decision making.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec11-brief-history-standards-4">Given that our current curricular structure exists for reasons that are no longer relevant, we are faced with the reality that old choices also shape current perception of the mathematics we teach.  For algebra, we need to ask the questions of what is algebra and why do we view it as we do, before we can address how best to teach it.  Suppose you were to ask the person on the street to describe algebra.  What sort of response would you get?  What about mathematics in general?  This question was asked of a student from a Minnesota high school during ABC’s <em class="emphasis">Primetime Live</em> following the release of the results from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (ABC News, 1998).  In response to this question she replied, “It’s kind of a set in stone.  It’s procedure.  It’s a formula.  You learn the formula and you know how to do math.”</div>
<div class="para" id="sec11-brief-history-standards-5">Her perceptions of mathematics and, in particular, algebra, are not unique.  In fact, the argument could be made that this is the perception of the majority of people — even those who are well educated.  So, we must ask the question of why do so many people view mathematics as a set of procedures to be memorized? This question is of particular interest as we explore the teaching and learning of algebra since so many algebra texts are structured in such a way as to perpetuate this view.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec11-brief-history-standards-6">Think back to your own algebra courses.  What were the items you remember most from your textbooks?  Can you recall shaded boxes housing formulae and “rules”?  Do you recall the “Laws of Exponents” prominently displayed on the page?  Did you ever think to question them?  Or did you ever wonder why they were presented in the text before any examples like <span class="process-math">\(a^2 \cdot a^3=a^5\)</span> were even discussed?  Maybe this is the reason society holds a very procedural and limited view of algebra.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec11-brief-history-standards-7">In this text, we will explore not only the teaching and learning of algebra, but also the very nature of this branch of mathematics.  If we wish to understand how students learn mathematics, we must first ask questions about the nature of the mathematics to be learned.  If mathematics indeed is a set of procedures to be memorized as suggested in the quote given above, then there are certain strategies that can be employed to facilitate the memorization.  This would then be an appropriate method of teaching.  However, if the nature of mathematics is far more than the memorization of a set of rules, the strategies employed for learning mathematics will be completely different from those employed for memorization.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec11-brief-history-standards-8">Traditionally, mathematical content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge have been the main parts of a dichotomous preparation program for teachers.  Research suggests that this approach to the preparation of teachers is inadequate.  How can we separate mathematics and the teaching and learning of mathematics? Is it possible to learn how to teach devoid of specific content knowledge?  If so, then this would suggest that students learn language, social studies, art, science, and mathematics all the same way.  While there are many common aspects of teaching and learning that resonate across many subject disciplines, the literature suggests that some disciplines have nuanced processes for learning that differ from other disciplines.  So, if students learn different subjects differently, why do we tend to separate the mathematical content for preservice teachers from the pedagogical content?  It is our opinion that both mathematical content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge need to develop simultaneously. For this reason, we will take a unified approach to integrate mathematical learning with the theories and practice for teaching.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec11-brief-history-standards-9">We have now stated our position as it relates to the integration of mathematical and pedagogical content knowledge, but how should this integration be accomplished?  In order to develop both mathematical and pedagogical content knowledge simultaneously, we first must ask ourselves how we come to know either of these.  To this end, we now discuss the theoretical model that guides our approach and this text.</div>

<section class="introduction" id="subsec-pirie-kieren-model-2"><div class="para" id="subsec-pirie-kieren-model-2-1">In order to understand the significance of both the explorations and the reflective practice combined in this text, we first will give an overview of the theoretical framework guiding our approach to the integration of mathematical and pedagogical content knowledge.  We have adopted the theory of growth of mathematical understanding put forth by Pirie and Kieren (1994) as our model for these materials and this will guide both the mathematical learning experiences and the pedagogical reflection in which the reader will engage throughout this course.  In addition, we will later utilize Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno’s (2008) model that elaborates on the mechanisms at play as a learner moves through the levels found in the Pirie and Kieren model from a symbolic (or semiotic) point of view.</div></section><div class="para" id="subsec-pirie-kieren-model-3">In order to understand the significance of both the explorations and the reflective practice combined in this text, we first will give an overview of the theoretical framework guiding our approach to the integration of mathematical and pedagogical content knowledge.  We have adopted the theory of growth of mathematical understanding put forth by Pirie and Kieren (1994) as our model for these materials and this will guide both the mathematical learning experiences and the pedagogical reflection in which the reader will engage throughout this course.  In addition, we will later utilize Kaput, Blanton, and Moreno’s (2008) model that elaborates on the mechanisms at play as a learner moves through the levels found in the Pirie and Kieren model from a symbolic (or semiotic) point of view.</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-pirie-kieren-model-4">In the Pirie and Kieren model, the growth of mathematical understanding occurs throughout eight levels. We are careful here to use the word “throughout” since we do not want to give the impression that these levels are linear.  In fact, their theory characterizes mathematical growth as a whole, dynamic, leveled but nonlinear, transcendently recursive process (Kieren and Pirie, 1991).  The Pirie and Kieren model is an elaboration of the constructivist view of understanding as a continuing organization of knowledge structures as described by von Glasersfeld (1987), but we must also consider that we have the ability to influence and shape each others understanding because learning is a social process (Vygotsky, 1978). Freeman et al. (2014) suggest that active learning where students are engaged in experiences rather than passively listening to an instructor promotes greater depth of understanding and so we will take this approach in this text.  In addition, communication also plays a role in our thinking as Sfard (2008) suggests and so we need to be mindful of these dynamically linked components of learning if we are to create an environment where exploration and student autonomy are key parts of concept development.</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-pirie-kieren-model-5">In order to visualize this model for growth of mathematical understanding consider the diagram below.</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-pirie-kieren-model-6"><figure class="figure figure-like" id="fig-pirie-kieren-diagram"><div class="image-box" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;"><img src="external/images/fig-pirie-kieren-diagram.png" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1.1.1<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Pirie and Kieren’s Model (1994, p. 167)</figcaption></figure></div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-pirie-kieren-model-7">Here the model is viewed as concentric circles or layers with each new layer containing the previous layers much like peeling an onion.  It is also important to note that there is not a single directional movement from inner to outer layers, but rather a student may move back and forth between layers as s/he works on organizing knowledge in a dynamic process of creating understanding.</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-pirie-kieren-model-8">It is also important to state that although this model does have an underlying hierarchy to its levels or layers, there is no intentional judgment of the outer layers being better or more advanced mathematically. In fact, as new mathematics is developed we often see experienced mathematicians moving through various levels of this model.  The innermost layer called, Primitive Knowing, does not imply a low-level understanding of concepts, but rather a basic series of knowledge and skills needed to pursue a new concept that is under development.  For example, the Primitive Knowing layer for a new concept being developed by the learner may actually represent an outermost layer of understanding for a previously developed concept that is utilized in the development of the new concept.  Pirie and Kieren use the example of fractions and decimals where a fairly sophisticated understanding of fractions is used as a starting point for the development of decimal concepts.  In a sense, this could be thought of as an onion within an onion (see <a href="sec11-brief-history-standards.html#fig-pirie-kieren-nest" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-pirie-kieren-nest.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 1.1.2">Figure 1.1.2</a>) to use our “garden” variety analogy.</div>

<div class="para" id="subsec-pirie-kieren-model-12">One feature of the Pirie and Kieren theory that relates to the teaching and learning of algebra specifically is the description of progression of abstraction from a symbolic sense.  You may have noticed some bold rings in the diagram above (<a href="sec11-brief-history-standards.html#fig-pirie-kieren-diagram" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-pirie-kieren-diagram.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 1.1.1">Figure 1.1.1</a>) describing the layers involved in this model.  These bold rings are referred to as the “don’t need” boundaries.  The bold rings are used to convey the idea that once students get past a “don’t need” boundary, they can now work in a more abstract sense without accessing specific inner understanding or images that were found within the bold boundary that gave rise to the understanding that is found in the outer region.  This is a significant part of the theory as it relates to algebra since one of the most important goals of the teaching and learning of algebra is bringing the student to higher and higher levels of abstraction.  We will address the role of abstraction in greater detail later, but here it is important to point out this aspect of the general theory guiding the text.</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-pirie-kieren-model-13">To this point we have simply described the nature of each level of the Pirie and Kieren model and how they fit together, but there is a more powerful aspect of the theory that makes it particularly useful in grappling with how mathematical understanding comes to be.  In order to explain mathematical understanding, we need to include a mechanism for explaining the growth.  In the Pirie and Kieren model, this mechanism is called <em class="emphasis">folding back</em>.</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-pirie-kieren-model-14">It is important to acknowledge that as we learn, there are varying depths of our understanding as related to any particular topic or concept.  We have all experienced this when we first learn about a new idea and can even use that mathematical idea to solve problems only to later encounter the same idea within a different context and be surprised by the new application of such an old idea.  This element of surprise is the evidence that our understanding of that idea has just deepened.  Pirie and Kieren account for this growth in the depth of understanding through the construct of <em class="emphasis">folding back</em>.  Basically, folding back is the learner’s ability to revert back to an inner layer of the understanding process in order to make sense of a situation or problem that is not readily solvable or understandable at the learner’s current level.  It is important to note that this return to prior levels is not similar to the experience the learner had previously in that earlier level, but rather is also influenced by the deeper understanding that has been obtained in the outer level as well.  The re-visitation to the inner level results in what Pirie and Kieren refer to as a <em class="emphasis">thickening</em> of the inner layer.  There is no unique pathway in which this thickening occurs since the number and manner of the folds backward are unique to the individual learner.  This process emphasizes that the levels or layers of this model of mathematical understanding do not occur in a single direction, but occur in a series of steps that involve the interactions of both older and newer levels of understanding.</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-pirie-kieren-model-15">The third and final feature of Pirie and Kieren’s model we wish to highlight is the structure that takes place within each layer or level.  Here, for each level beyond Primitive Knowing the levels are partitioned into two complementary modes: acting and expressing.  Both of these components of understanding are essential before moving on from the inner to the outer levels.  This elaboration of the model is given a graphic interpretation below with dotted lines representing the boundaries between modes.</div>
