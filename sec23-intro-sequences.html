<section class="introduction" id="sec23-intro-sequences-2"><div class="para" id="sec23-intro-sequences-2-1">In <a href="sec12-ccss-overview.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.2: Common Core State Standards for Mathematics">Section 1.2</a>, we looked at the CCSS and noted that young learners tended be adept at analyzing patterns.  Sequences are a type of pattern that can take on many representations and can allow for various approaches by students for analyzing and solving them.  For this reason, this section will examine how students see sequences from both a mathematical and pedagogical perspective. While there are many different kinds of sequences, we will focus primarily on arithmetic, geometric, figurative, and recursive sequences.  We will ground our discussion in some classroom excerpts where students are grappling with patterns and also address how the students begin to represent these patterns and the effect this has on their thinking.  To begin, we should define what we mean by a sequence.</div>

<div class="para" id="act-evaluate-me-again-sam-2-1">You may have at one time used a scientific or standard calculator and entered an evaluation for <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> and then continued to press the [√] or [=] key only to see the decimal approximation eventually get closer and closer to 1.  This illustrates values of an infinite sequence where each element of the sequence is obtained by taking the previous element in the sequence and plugging it into a given function.  In this investigation we will explore such sequences and look for common properties.</div>
<div class="para" id="act-evaluate-me-again-sam-2-2">
<em class="emphasis">Problem Statement</em>:  In the example given above, a specific function, <span class="process-math">\(f\left(x\right)=\sqrt{x}\text{,}\)</span> and a specific starting point, <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{,}\)</span> were used to generate the sequence.  In this exploration, consider a more general question.  Suppose you have a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and the infinite sequence, <span class="process-math">\(f\left(x_0\right), f\left(f\left(x_0\right)\right), f\left(f\left(f\left(x_0\right)\right)\right), \ldots\text{.}\)</span> In this exploration, we will examine this sequence for some specific families of functions and then generate more questions for further investigation.</div>

<div class="para" id="act-evaluate-me-again-sam-2-4">Here we will use the <em class="emphasis">TI-Nspire CX II CAS</em>, but this can also be done with a variety of other computer algebra systems.  To begin, we will explore a very familiar function, <span class="process-math">\(f\left(x\right)=ax^2\text{,}\)</span> for various values of the parameter, <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span>  Open a new document and select <em class="emphasis">1:New Document</em>. When prompted, select <em class="emphasis">2:Add Graphs</em> to open a graphing screen.  Enter the function <span class="process-math">\(f_1\left(x\right)=x^2\)</span> in the command line at the bottom of the screen and press [enter] to display the graph.  You will be able to morph this graph later by grabbing it in order to explore the effect of the parameter, <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> on the sequence.</div>

<div class="para" id="act-evaluate-me-again-sam-2-6">In order to observe the behavior of this sequence graphically, generate a sequence plot by plotting the term number vs. the iterate values.  To do this, insert a new page by pressing [ctrl] [+page] and then selecting <em class="emphasis">2:Add Graphs</em>.  In this case, you do not want to graph a function, but the sequence points.  To change the type of graph, press [menu] and then select <em class="emphasis">3:Graph Entry/Edit</em> followed by <em class="emphasis">7:Sequence</em> and <em class="emphasis">1:Sequence</em>.  You will notice that the command line at the top of the screen will change yielding fields into which you can enter the sequence relationship and initial value (see images below).  Since we want to generate an iterative sequence based on the function stored in <span class="process-math">\(f1\left(x\right)\text{,}\)</span> we enter <span class="process-math">\(u1\left(n\right)=f1\left(u1\left(n-1\right)\right)\)</span> so that the sequence plotter will use the function value of the pervious number in the sequence to generate the new number in the sequence.  Use 0.5 as your initial value for now.  You can adjust the viewing window by grabbing a tick mark on the axis by holding down the "click/grab" key located in the center of the NavPad (mouse pad) until the hand closes.  Dragging your finger across the NavPad will adjust the view.  If you want to adjust only one axis scale at a time, simply hold down the [shift] key while you move on the screen.  To adjust where the axes are located within the window, move to any open space in the graphing window and hold the "click/grab" key down until the hand closes, then move the entire graph to any location you desire (see images below).</div>

In order to do this press [+page] to insert a new page and then press [esc] since you do not wish to insert just one application, but two in a side-by-side layout.  Now press [doc] and select <em class="emphasis">5:Page Layout</em> and <em class="emphasis">2:Select Layout</em> followed by <em class="emphasis">2:Layout 2</em>.

<div class="para" id="act-evaluate-me-again-sam-2-12">In order to copy the graph page for both the function and the scatter plot, you must first select them.  Page back to the function graph by pressing [ctrl] followed by the left arrow until you get to the page you want.  Unfortunately you cannot just copy the page, but must “select” it first.  To do this, press [doc] and then select <em class="emphasis">5:Page Layout</em> followed by <em class="emphasis">3:Select App</em>.  In the future, the shortcut for selecting an application is [ctrl][K].  You will see the border of the screen begin to flash indicating it is selected.  Then press [ctrl][C] to copy it (just like on a computer). Now page back to the split screen by pressing [ctrl] followed by the right arrow until you reach it. To paste the graphing screen into the left side, just press [ctrl][V] (like paste on a computer).  To get the sequence plot pasted into the right side of the screen, repeat this process, but you will need to click on the right side of the screen to make it active before pasting.  You will know that a portion of the screen is active since it will have a darkened border around it (see screens below).</div>

<div class="para" id="subsec-recursive-sequences-12">The previous explorations have given us some insight into predicting when an iterative sequence will converge and when it might diverge.  So how can we be certain of the behavior and then, as teachers, help our students discover the properties behind the behavior?  Here we will take a deeper look into the observations made in our previous investigations and see how iterative sequences can play a role in practical applications.</div>
<div class="para" id="subsec-recursive-sequences-13">The concept of iteration is an important part of the mathematical landscape.  It is used in real-world applications to find solutions that have no direct algebraic solution as well as for approximating values of mathematical constants such as <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\pi\text{.}\)</span>  Having taken Calculus, you are already familiar with one such iteration process, Newton’s Method.  Recall that Newton’s Method allows the approximation of roots by using the projection along a tangent line to the x-axis as a new approximation of the root.  Then the new value from the x-axis is used as the new point of tangency and the process continues until the desired level of accuracy for the root is achieved.</div>

To be able to approximate a solution, Isaac Newton noticed that as a point on a curve approaches the root of the function, its tangent line at that point begins to have an x-intercept that is approximately the root desired (see <a href="sec23-intro-sequences.html#fig-newton-method-tangents" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-newton-method-tangents.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 2.3.4">Figure 2.3.4</a>).</div>

<div class="para" id="subsec-recursive-sequences-42">So what does this theorem say about convergence to fixed points?  Basically, the theorem says that if the fixed point, <span class="process-math">\(z\text{,}\)</span> is in an interval where <span class="process-math">\(\left|f'\left(x\right)\right| \gt 1\text{,}\)</span> then the mapping that transforms the outputs to inputs back into the function is expanding and thus the iteration process diverges.</div>

<div class="para" id="subsec-recursive-sequences-44">Although Newton’s Method is very efficient for finding zeros of a function, a more simplistic method involves only the iteration of a function with itself using only a small alteration.  Suppose you are looking for the root of a polynomial, <span class="process-math">\(p\left(x\right)\text{.}\)</span>  The process boils down to solving the equation, <span class="process-math">\(p\left(x\right)=0\text{.}\)</span>  Now consider the transformed equation formed by adding <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to both sides of the original equation, <span class="process-math">\(p\left(x\right)+x=x\text{.}\)</span>  If we let <span class="process-math">\(q\left(x\right)=p\left(x\right)+x\text{,}\)</span> we are essentially finding a solution to <span class="process-math">\(q\left(x\right)=x\text{.}\)</span> We know from our earlier discussion that this solution is simply a fixed point for <span class="process-math">\(q\left(x\right)\text{.}\)</span> Based on the fact that repeated iteration will converge to a fixed point (if convergence does occur), we can simply take the original function, add <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> and then iterate it with itself as a method to find its root.  The down side of this process is that not all fixed points are accessible through iteration as we have seen in earlier examples.  However, this does remain a very simple algorithm for finding roots although not as efficient as Newton’s Method.</div></section><section class="subsection" id="subsec-figurative-sequences"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
